Azwihangwisi Ramukhadi (46), a male nurse at Donald Frazer Hospital who allegedly defrauded a car accident victim by pretending to be a lawyer and offering to help him with his Road Accident Fund (RAF) claim, is expected back in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo the suspect has appeared in court on Friday and granted
R1 500 bail and warned to be back at court on Monday.
He indicated that the suspect allegedly defrauded a car accident victim with R1 500 and was arrested early Friday morning.
It is alleged that on 10 August 2019 the suspect requested contact numbers of the victim who was admitted at the mentioned hospital after a car crash. After the patient was discharged a few days later he reportedly received a phone call from the suspect pretending to be a lawyer who can assist with his RAF claim, according to Mojapelo. Ramukhadi allegedly then requested the victim to deposit
R1 500 into his account in order for him to continue processing the claim. Several months later the victim made a follow-up on the case but the suspect requested more money. The victim then became suspicious and contacted the Police which led to the nurse’s arrest.
Police urged all community members who may have fallen victims of similar scams to come forward and report the matter at the nearest Police station or to contact the Crime Stop Number on 08600 10111.
