Two women aged 27 and 41 year are expected to appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court today (Thursday) after they were arrested by members of the Hawks for being in possession of explosives yesterday (Wednesday).
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke indicated that they received a tip-off that two Zimbabwean women travelling to Gauteng were allegedly in possession of explosives.
He explained that Hawks officials who traced the women to a lodge in Thohoyandou constantly monitored their movements and eventually arrested them the moment they boarded a bus destined for Gauteng.
The women’s luggage was searched and explosives, emulsion blasting cartridges and case fuses with an estimated street value in excess of R1,2 million were discovered.
Maluleke indicated the suspects would face charges of unlawful possession of explosives and contravention of the Immigration Act.
