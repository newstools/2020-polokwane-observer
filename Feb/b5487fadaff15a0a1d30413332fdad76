Learners at Mitchell House were treated to great performances by the South African Navy Band during their Valentine’s Day celebration on Friday.
The day was also used to raise funds for the school’s Enrichment Centre by allowing learners to wear casual clothes rather than uniform and paying R10 for the privilege.
Headmaster Andrew Cook indicated that they had invited the band to entertain learners on the day and that the money raised will be used at the centre which caters for 24 persons living with disability.
The band led by Lindela Madikizela set the stage alight with performances of well-known songs such as Hallelujah, O Nketsang, Something inside so Strong and African Dream.
