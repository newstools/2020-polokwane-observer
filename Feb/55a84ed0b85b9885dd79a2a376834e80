Former Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs Football Club defender, Tlou Molekwane opened a football academy in Ladanna on Saturday.
The Tlou Molekwane Football Academy will cater for aspiring soccer players between the ages of 6 and 15 years from Polokwane and surrounds.
The Seshego born lad who won the MTN 8 Cup and Telkom Knockout Cup in the 2009/2010 season with Kaizer Chiefs Football Club said the initiative is one of his ways of giving back to the community. “I have always wanted to create a platform for youngsters to flourish and realise their soccer potential at an early age because I never had the opportunity. We will be teaching them basic football and socials skills because to prosper in football one needs to have good social skills. I will also be sharing my football knowledge and expertise with them,” Molekwane concluded.
