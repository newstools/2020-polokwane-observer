Police on Tuesday evening arrested a 50-year-old suspect who allegedly killed his four children at Ga-Phasha village, Mecklenburg on Monday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the bodies of the children were found at separate locations in the area.
He explained that the suspect on Tuesday morning allegedly informed a neighbour telephonically about the murders the previous day and also directed him to the places where the bodies could be found. The neighbour immediately informed the Police and the bodies of three children aged 9, 7 and 5 were found among nearby vegetation while the three-year-old’s corpse was found in a mountainous area about 3 km from the first scene.
Three of the children were found with stab wounds while the youngest also sustained fatal open wounds.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the father on Monday afternoon stopped the vehicle transporting the children from school and the driver subsequently released the children in the father’s care.
The children were identified but the names are being withheld for the time being.
The motive for the brutal murders is not yet known and Police are continuing their investigation into the matter.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba visited the scene and reportedly condemned the incident in the strongest possible terms more so as it was allegedly perpetrated by someone who was supposed to protect the victims.
Anyone with information is requested to contact investigating officer Phillip Mohlala on 082 414 3070 or report to the nearest Police station.
