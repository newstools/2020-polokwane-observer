The interim Board of the Gateway Airports Authority Limited (Gaal) reportedly took a decision to suspend both the entityâ€™s Chief Executive Officer and Senior Operations Manager on Friday.
This is according to the Department of Transport and Community Safety spokesperson, Joel Seabi who indicated that the two were on precautionary suspension with full pay following serious allegations of misconduct. He outlined that the suspension is meant to allow the entity to investigate the alleged acts of misconduct without possible hindrance.
Seabi emphasised that the department would promptly facilitate the appointment of acting personnel to ensure smooth running of the entity and continued services to its clients and stakeholders. He added that it remained the determination of Transport and Community Safety MEC Dickson Masemola to turn Gaal around in various ways for it to discharge both its aeronautical and non-aeronautical services and assert it as a performing entity for socio-economic development in the province.
