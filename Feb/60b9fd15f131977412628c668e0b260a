73 enthusiastic golfers who entered Polo­kwane Golf Club’s individual Stableford challenge on Saturday were not in te least perturbed by the loud noise coming from activities hosted by the South African Defence Force at the Polokwane Cricket.
Willie Opperman emerged as the winner after completing the challenge with 41 points. He was followed by Harshad Mistry also with 41 points. Anton van Vuuren made the jackpot lucky draw at holes two, three, 15 and 16 but none of the golfers managed to win 1 300 units payable on the day.
Last Wednesday’s golfing competition saw Nelson Marais taking the lead with 41 points, followed by Piet Fourie with 39 points while Liano Viviers settled for the third spot with 38.
