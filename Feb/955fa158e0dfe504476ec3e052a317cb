Salome Ledwaba (49), a company secretary at Gateway Airport Authority Limited (Gaal) is expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on 10 February after she was arrested in the city last Thursday for allegedly hiring hitmen to kill her husband.
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke indicated that Ledwaba was remanded after her appearance in the local magistrate’s court on Friday and is expected to apply for bail during her upcoming appearance.
Maluleke remarked that Ledwaba, a former senior manager at Capricorn District Municipality, was allegedly experiencing marital problems and reportedly solicited the help of hitmen to kill her husband in exchange for a R50 000 payment.
Through intelligence gathering, the Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit uncovered the plot and immediately put a plan to action to apprehend Ledwaba, it was learnt.
Maluleke said investigations revealed that Ledwaba is married to a well-known businessman who also resides around Polokwane and that the couple is on the verge of a divorce. His identity is being protected.
