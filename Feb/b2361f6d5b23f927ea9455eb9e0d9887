The Polokwane Marathon with winning prizes amounting to R150 000 will be hosted by Polokwane Athletic Club in collaboration with Capricorn District Municipality (CDM) at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday from 06:00. Approximately 3 000 athletes are expected to participate in this Comrades and Two Oceans qualifier over 10, 21,1 and 42,2 km as well as a fun run over 5 km.
At the media launch at CDM’s offices on Tuesday, Executive Mayor John Mpe said that a number of dignitaries, to include MECs, mayors and municipal councillors will participate and that he plans to take on the 42,2 km stretch. “The race is for young and old and it is not only for winning, but for participation. Our aim is to promote a healthy lifestyle in our communities because a healthy community is an asset that can not be quantified in monetary terms,” Mpe said. “Live healthy and live long!,” Mpe added.
According to Mpe, the event will boost the business fraternity of the city and the district and will therefore contribute to the local economy.
Mpe confirmed that he will attend the upcoming Comrades Marathon in Durban as a supporter and announced that CDM will again provide transport to all qualifying athletes from the district. “We are able to commit our support thanks to our strategic partners Nedbank and Legacy Polokwane and will also host a send-off function for our athletes” Mpe said.
Chairman of Polokwane Athletic Club, Pieter Pretorius also announced that the South African Defence Force will be part of the 5 km fun run that forms part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations that starts in the city tomorrow (Friday).
Entry fees for the 10, 21,1 and 42,2 km as well as the fun run over 5 km are R80, R120, R200 and R50 respectively and a temporary licence costs R30.
