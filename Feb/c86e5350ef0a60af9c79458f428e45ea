At Eagle’s Nest Christian School the air was filled with song, praise and worship recently when learners and educators celebrated ‘Love Jesus Day’.
Learners from all grades had thoroughly prepared their musical items that they rendered on the day to confirm their love for Jesus. All the participants had fun following their wonderful performances that left the crowd asking for more. Love Jesus Day is celebrated at the school annual during February for learners and educators to worship God and experience his love too, it was learnt.
