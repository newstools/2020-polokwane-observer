Following their massive 4-0 victory against North West University Football Club in the last 32 match of the Nedbank Cup at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday, Black Leopards Football Club is determined to reach the final of the competition.
The last time they reached the final was in 2011 when they lost 3-1 to Orlando Pirates Football Club at Mbombela Stadium.
They will face the Eastern Cape based ABC Motsepe campaigners, Amavarara Football Club in the last 16 matches of the competition scheduled for 22 February at Thohoyandou Stadium.
Amavarara eliminated GladAfrica championship side Super Eagles Football Club from the competition after beating them 2-1 at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Eastern Cape on Friday.
Managing director Tshifhiwa Thidiela said Leopards’ objective was to do well in the competition and eventually reach the final. “We want to succeed in the competition and we do not want to undermine any club. We are playing Amavarara and we don’t know anything about them. All we know is that they are in the bottom half of the ABC Motsepe League and we cannot underestimate them. We can’t afford to relax and we will fight until we reach the final of the competition,” Thidiela said.
