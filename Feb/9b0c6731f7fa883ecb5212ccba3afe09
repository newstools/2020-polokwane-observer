A 26-year-old woman and her 28-year-old boyfriend were expected to appear in the Mokopane Magistrate’s Court this morning (Monday) on charges of murder following the death of the woman’s four-year-old daughter early yesterday (Sunday) morning.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the incident happened at Extension 20, Mokopane. The fatal event apparently stemmed from the man, not the biological father of the child, allegedly became agitated when the little child started playing with him. He reportedly then took a cell phone charger cable and assaulted the child in the presence of the mother who apparently did nothing to stop the attack thus making herself complicit in the attack, according to Mojapelo.
It was learnt that the couple had let the severely injured child go to sleep and only discovered later that morning that she had succumbed to her injuries.
Mojapelo said that the boyfriend later handed himself to Police and preliminary investigations lead to the arrest of the mother.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba condemned the incident, especially when parents harm their own children instead of protecting them. Parents are called upon to daily perform aavital role of providing security to their children at all instances and under no circumstances subject them to assault.
The duo will face a charge of murder.
