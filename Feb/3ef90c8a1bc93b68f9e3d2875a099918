Nearly 2 700 athletes gathered at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium early on Saturday morning to participate in the annual Polokwane Marathon sponsored by Capricorn District Municipality (CDM) in conjunction with Polokwane Athletic Club.
Well-known twins Lesiba and Tlou Peu were the first runners home in the 10 km and 21,1 km open division for men respectively. Lesiba finished the 10 km in a time of 29:45 while his brother completed the 21,1 km in 1:06.28.
M Moketla was the first female athlete in the 10 km with a time of 37:17 while G Ramabela was the first woman across the finish line in the 21,1 km with a time of 1:34.16.
Former Pietersburg Road Runner (PRR) Calvin Malatji who now competes in Murray and Roberts colours finished first in the 42,2 km marathon with a time of 2:31.45 while J Netsithenze’s time of 3:26.45 earned her the first position in the woman’s category of the marathon.
CDM Executive Mayor John Mpe, setting the perfect example for people to maintain a healthy lifestyle, sucessfully participated in the 10km.
PAC Chairperson Pieter Pretorius said the race was once again a huge success and the large number of entrants proof of the popularity of the event.
