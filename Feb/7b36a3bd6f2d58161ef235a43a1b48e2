Big smiles and a happy mood characterised Lebowa Funerals’ visit to Mponegele Primary School when 117 pairs of school shoes were presented to less fortunate learners on Friday.
The management of Lebowa Funerals was joined by African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Boy Mamabolo for a joint effort at ploughing back to the community.
Lebowa Funerals Marketing Manager George Sethosa indicated that the donation is a way of thanking the community for their support since 1976. “We thank the parents through the children and this event was just another of the annual presentations made by Lebowa Funerals. This year we noticed the need for shoes at Mponegele Primary School because most parents are unemployed and do not have money for school necessities,” Sethosa said.
He added that the school lies close to the heart of Lebowa Funeral’s Managing Director William Tema who started his school career at Mponogele in 1973.
Mamabolo himself attended the school in 1989. He indicated that 700 pairs of shoes have already been distributed in the area and they hoped to reach the target of 1 000 pairs soon.
He called on everyone to assist as no child deserves to go to school barefoot.
