Provincial Government spokesperson Phuti Seloba is expected back in the office on Monday after a bargaining council award reportedly reinstating him Wednesday.
Fourteen months after his temporary removal his suspension was declared unfair, it was learnt. In terms of the ruling, of which a copy was provided to Polokwane Observer, he was reinstated into his old position and granted compensation equal to four monthsâ€™ salary, in addition to having received full benefits during the period of suspension.
Seloba was initially suspended on charges related to alleged leaking of information to a political leader, but according to information the charges have since been changed and not been pursued.
This is an unfolding story.
