Police could at the time of going to print not provide any update about the court appearance of three suspects arrested when intercepted and found in possession of abalone worth R7 million in the city on Friday afternoon.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe on Saturday indicated that the suspects were expected to appear in the Polo­kwane Magistrate’s Court early this week.
An intelligence-driven operation comprised of the Provincial Endangered Species Unit, Polokwane Crime Intelligence Unit, Western Cape Provincial Crime Intelligence Unit, Polokwane K9 Unit and Police at Polokwane International Airport led to the interception of an alleged crime syndicate transporting abalone.
Ngoepe said Police following up on information circulated to the provincial Police intercepted a Nissan NP200 bakkie travelling from Polokwane to Beitbridge port of entry.
The vehicle was stopped in Polokwane and searched, whereupon Police discovered 37 boxes of abalone worth R7 million on board.
Three suspects were arrested and the origin and destination of the suspects and the abalone will be determined through ongoing investigations, it was learnt.
