Polokwane Municipality will introduce water shedding with immediate effect in an attempt to ensure that all areas of supply receive a sufficient supply of water for most of the day by shutting off all reservoir outlets from 20:00 until 04:00 on a daily basis.
Municipal Manager Dikgape Makobe announced this drastic intervention during a media briefing at the municipality earlier this morning (Wednesday).
Makobe explained that this will allow reservoir levels to rehabilitate to such an extent that water pressure will be increased and water will also reach the higher catchment areas when it is released in the early mornings.
