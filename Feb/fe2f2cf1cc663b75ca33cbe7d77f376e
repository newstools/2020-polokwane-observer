Aubrey Manaka (28), suspected of the murder of Capricorn TVET College student Precious Ramabulana on 24 November last year, was expected to appear in the Morebeng Magistrate’s Court again on Tuesday after the matter was postponed for further investigation by the same court last Thursday.
Manaka faces charges of murder, housebreaking with intend to commit an offence, rape and robbery, according to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo.
He was arrested at his parental home in Nyakelang village, Botlokwa four days after Ramabulana’s killing following an intensive manhunt by members of the Provincial Crime Intelligence Unit, Limpopo Hawks, forensics officers and detectives.
During his arrest he was allegedly found in possession of Ramabulana’s cell phone, bloodstained clothes and a sharp object, according to Mojapelo.
Preliminary investigations revealed that Ramabulana was asleep in her room at Ga-Joel Section in Mokomene when she was stabbed to death.
During investigations, it was also established that the suspect was reportedly involved in a rape case of a 4-year-old girl during 2014 around the same area.
The case has since been reinstated and the suspect is expected to appear before court soon, it was learnt.
