Baroka Football Club finalised signing a six month contract with an option to extend with former Black Leopards and Bidvest Football Club striker, Ivan Mahangwahaya last Thursday.
The-30-year old, versatile player spend seven years at Leopards and joined Bidvest Wits in August last year.
He was part of the Leopards team that gained promotion to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in the 2017/2018 season.
The club’s marketing manager, Richard Mashabane said they could have opted for any other player on the market but chose Mahangwahaya because of his experience. “He has wealth of PSL experience and I think he will help us in our quest of finishing the league in a decent position,” Mashabane said.
The Ga-Mphahlele based outfit is currently struggling with form and they need maximum points in order to stay afloat in the league.
Their 0-l loss against Highlands Park Football Club on Saturday night at Makhulong Stadium plummets them on the 14th position of the PSL log with 20 points after 21 matches.
