An intelligence-driven operation comprised of the Provincial Endangered Species Unit, Polokwane Crime Intelligence Unit, Western Cape Provincial Crime Intelligence Unit, Polokwane K9 Unit and Police at Polokwane International Airport led to the interception of an alleged crime syndicate transporting abalone in Polokwane last night (Friday).
According to Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe Police intercepted a Nissan NP200 bakkie which was traveling from Polokwane to Beitbridge Port of Entry after following up on information circulated to the provincial Police.
The vehicle was stopped in Polokwane and searched, whereupon Police discovered 37 boxes of abalone worth R7 million on board.
Three suspects were arrested and are expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrateâ€™s Court during the week.
The origin and destination of the suspects and the abalone will be determined through ongoing investigations, it was learnt.
