Junior Phase learners and toddlers of Squirrel’s Nest at Mitchell House shared in the excitement of outdoor sport when they participated in the centre’s annual mini Olympics last Thursday.
Parents and educators also joined in the fun as they coached the young participants in long jump, shot put, hula-hoop dash, water bucket drop, egg races and the very popular pillowcase racing.
The Harman Team won the Spirit Cup for support of their team.
