The Rotary Club of Polokwane presented the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca) Limpopo with a donation of R10 000 during the club’s weekly meeting at Our Home/Ons Tuiste on Monday evening.
President of the club, Wedi Oloko said the donation was a token of Rotary’s appreciation and gratitude for the sterling job that Sanca is doing in Polokwane and in Limpopo as such.
Registered Nurse Sue Pitcairn and Social Worker Dzunisani Ndhlovu accepted the donation from Oloko.
Pitcairn thanked the Rotarians and said that the money will be used to buy much needed equipment for the local centre.
She invited the Rotarians to visit the facility in order to learn more about the services rendered there.
