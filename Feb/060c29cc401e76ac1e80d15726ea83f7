Final preparations are currently underway at the Jack Botes Hall for the official opening of the Legislature and the State of the Province Address (Sopa) that is expected to be delivered by Premier Stan Mathabatha at the same venue tomorrow (Thursday).
Police and traffic officials are sharpening their parade skills while municipal workers repaint road markings in Bodenstein Street opposite the hall. Traffic is a bit congested on the corner of Kerk and Bodenstein streets caused by road closure to allow law enforcers to utilise the space from the Department Transport and Community Safety until at the corner of Thabo Mbeki and Kerk streets for their training session.
More road closures can be expected tomorrow as the Speakership of the Legislature pronounced during the Pre-Sopa media briefing on Tuesday that streets that will be temporarily closed on the day of Sopa are Thabo Mbeki, Rabe, Biccard, Bodenstein, Landdros Mare, Hans Van Rensburg, Church and Schoeman streets.
