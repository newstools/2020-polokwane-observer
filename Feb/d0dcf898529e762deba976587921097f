It was learnt that Harris was among a group of people who advocated for the establishment of Westenburg during the apartheid regime. In his earlier days he was a member of the African National Congress and also served as a member of the provincial Legislature, it was learnt. According to his granddaughter Mashadi Mangale, Harris was born on 10 April 1931 and died in the early hours of Sunday. She stated that his death shocked the family and the province because her ‘Oupa’ was healthy and still worked at his farm every day.

Mangale further indicated that Harris went for his routine medical procedure on Saturday but never returned home: “Oupa was not sick. He was strong at the age of 88 and drove to the farm everyday. He is one of the Westenburg founders and the main street in the area is named after him. He was an entrepreneur. Oupa was a significant figure in Westenburg and the province,” Mangale explained.
Dates and venues for the funeral are to be confirmed.
