Jukskei players from 13 primary and 11 secondary schools in the city and as far as Thabazimbi engaged in intense competition during the first round of the 2020 schools league played at Pietersburg Jukskei Club on Saturday.
Each team played five games with the hope of earning the most points. The highlight of the day was when two 5-year-old girls Angelina Kkoutas and Danika Otto from Laerskool Pietersburg-Oos took on older contestants as they competed in the u.13 division. The challenge was also attended by four local South African colours holders Ansonel, Ethan, Druan and Jayden Venter.
Organiser Willa Viljoen indicated that Limpopo u.13 boys’ team had emerged victorious at the national championships in December.
The team won the title for the second consecutive year following their first win in 2018, she explained. She further emphasised that Ansonel was part of the national team that is set to embark on a tour to Namibia later in the year. Viljoen added that they had players who competed in Botswana and Lesotho last year.
She encouraged players to practice hard in order to make it to the nationals to earn South African colours and get to tour other countries. Although it can be costly to embark on international tours, Viljoen emphasised that it was worth it because such trips exposed players to things that can shape them into better players and individuals.
She concluded that the next round to be jointly hosted by Curro Heuwelkruin and Hoër Tegniese Skool Tom Naudé was scheduled for 23 May.
