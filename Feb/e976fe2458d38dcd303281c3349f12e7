A suspect reportedly fell to his death when he spotted Police approaching him while he was allegedly busy stealing cell phone tower batteries, transformer cables and oil at Mohokoni village outside Tzaneen on Tuesday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Police had received a tip-off about persons busy tampering with the transformer at the said premises. Police found two suspects busy dismantling the transformer and having already drained the transmission oil into a container.
One suspect fled while firing shots at the Police who retaliated and chased after him. He was later arrested at Mohokoni tarred road and is currently under Police guard at a local hospital where he is receiving treatment for injuries sustained during the shootout with the Police.
The second suspect apparently made use of a makeshift stepladder and was found still on the pole. He allegedly tried to evade arrest by jumping off. He reportedly hit the ground head first and was certified dead on the scene.
Unaware of the Police on the scene two other suspects apparently came to fetch the stolen goods but were immediately arrested.
Mojapelo indicated that the suspects, aged between 27 and 43, were from Hammanskraal.
They are expected to appear in Bolobedu Magistrateâ€™s Court today (Thursday).
