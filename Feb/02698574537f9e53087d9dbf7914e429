Bushveld Racing Club recently hosted a successful Valentine’s Race at their oval race track in Mokopane which resulted in more than just love in the air as competitors showed no mercy in the adrenaline-rushing event.
In the Stockrods class Anroux Pienaar took first place with Jossie McDonald and Wessel Smit in second and third respectively.
McDonald and Smit were not able to attend the prize giving and according to the rules the next performing driver will then receive the trophy which resulted in Izak Oosthuyzen and MJ Bekker taking home the trophies as runner- and second runner-up respectively.
In the junior Stockrods class Zahné Smith claimed victory, leaving second and third place to Karlo Ruytenberg and Jacques Strydom.
Petrus van Oorde took first position on the podium in 1660 class with Boela Bekker second and Francois Lewis third.
The ever popular 2,1 litres class was ruled by Polokwane racer Haccum Hough with Dirk Potgieter second and Rudi Meijer third.
In the Hotrods class Frans Joubert was handed the chequered flag at the end of the night leaving second and third podium positions to Jacque Maree and Marnus du Plessis.
Oval racing enthusiasts are invited to support the National Hotrod Tour to be hosted at the Bushveld Racing Club on 14 March.
