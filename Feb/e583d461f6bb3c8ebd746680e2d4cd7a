Last Saturday evening was party time when members of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 invaded the city in a party bus during their annual progressive dinner.
The theme of the event was ‘Scary movies’ and some of them dressed to the theme thereby adding a colourful ambience to the party.
The bus departed from the Polokwane Bowls Club where mini pancakes with a savoury chicken filling, served by Bok and Judith van Kraayenburg, were washed down with cocktails concocted by Johan Joubert. This was followed by a snails in garlic cream starter at the home of Naas and Charlie Vorster.
The next stop was at Casper Gilfillan and Tina Helberg, where the thirsty Rotarians prepared their palates for the main course with aperitifs. Jaco and Joan Nortjé were responsible for the main course, an expertly prepared venison potjie that did not disappoint. The last stop was at Richard and Marlene Wilson’s where the guests indulged in pavlova, mini milktarts, chocolate mousse and a Peppermint Crisp delight with champers to round off a delightful evening.
