Participants are once again reminded that online entries for Limpopoâ€™s only open water swim, the annual Ebenezer Mile, are already open and they are encouraged to enter as soon as possible.
The event is expected to be hosted at Old Smokey Club House at Ebenezer Dam just outside Haenertsburg on 21 March.
Organisers indicated that the event would continue despite low water levels.
The event is sanctioned by Swimming South Africa and organised by the Rotary Club of Haenertsburg.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Ebenezer Mile and promises to be yet another fun-filled event for amateur and professional swimmers as well as supporters.
Serious swimmers can enter for the traditional mile (1 600 m) or the 3 000 m while a fun swim of 500 m will also be hosted for those looking to just enjoy the water.
A variety of food stalls and beer garden are guaranteed to add to the festive atmosphere.
The first race is set to start at 11:00.
