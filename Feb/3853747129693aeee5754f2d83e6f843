Hoërskool Noorderland awarded its top 5 performers in each of grades 8 to 11 based on the marks they attained in last year’s final year examinations during the school’s awards ceremony held last Tuesday evening.
The achievers received floating trophies, scientific calculators and R250 in cash each.
Noorderland principal Thabo Ratema said the learners’ achievements will inspire and motivate their fellow students at the school. “They have done for themselves as well as for the school. We encourage them to continue their hard work and dedication. They will contribute vastly to our efforts in attaining a 100% matric pass,” he said.
