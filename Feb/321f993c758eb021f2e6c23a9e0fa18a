Police have arrested a 26-year-old suspect for allegedly raping a 52-year-old woman in a rural settlement outside Thabazimbi yesterday (Sunday).
According to Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe the woman was allegedly asleep when the suspect broke into her house, attacked her and allegedly raped her.
The suspect afterwards reportedly fell asleep in the woman’s bed, giving the victim the opportunity to escape and call the Police, according to Ngoepe. Police reacted quickly and arrested the suspect while still asleep.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect was previously arrested and sentenced to six months imprisonment for housebreaking and theft.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Thabazimbi Magistrate’s Court during the the week.
