High drama ensued in Church Street on Monday when the SPS High Risk Unit/Tracker SA, Police Air Wing and Polokwane Police clamped down on a premises where an allegedly stolen vehicle was found that seemingly led to the discovery of a bigger vehicle theft syndicate operating between Limpopo and Gauteng. SPS High Risk Unit/Tracker SA with the assistance of the eye in the sky stormed the house, occupied by approximately 15 people, where vehicle tyres are also being sold during the day.
A white BMW, jacked up and with the exhaust being removed, was noticed in the drive-way of the premises.
Occupants of the house were ordered to lie on the ground while backup from Polokwane Police was being awaited.
On the scene it was indicated that authorities had received information about the BMW allegedly being stolen in Bekkersdal, Gauteng recently. The vehicle was traced which led to the discovery in Church Street.
According to information the incident points to a bigger syndicate being operational. The syndicate would purportedly steal a vehicle and deliver it to the buyer. The buyer would then pay the money but not receive the registration papers of the vehicle. The syndicate would then report the vehicle as stolen causing the buyer to lose the money and the vehicle, it was learnt.
The driver of the BMW as well as several undocumented foreigners found in the house were apprehended on the spot.
It was later learnt that Police had apparently proceeded to Lebowakgomo to trace more persons suspected of being involved in the syndicate.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe could not provide any details and at the time of going to print indicated that he was struggling to get information about the incident.
