PEPPS Preparatory School and College hosted the provincial semi-finals for the South African Championships of Performing Arts (Sacopa) at the institution last Wednesday.
Several learners from the school contested and all are through to the the finals scheduled for 20 to 29 March in Rustenburg. PEPPS Grade 9 learner Gift Ogwu, a gold medallist from last year, was chosen for the nationals. She plans to win gold again this year to secure a spot in a national team that will represent South Africa on an international stage during the World Championships of Performing Arts (WCPA) in Los Angeles. Sacopa categories include acting, dance, vocal, modelling, instrumental and group performances.
PEPPS communication and marketing officer Millisa Naidoo said “We would like to thank the contestants who attended the event from around Polokwane as well as the University of Limpopo music students who took part and went through to the finals. We would like to wish them all the best in the finals. Those who will win the finals will earn an opportunity to participate on an international stage in Los Angeles.”
