Police have warned motorists travelling on the N1 between Polokwane and Pretoria to be vigilant at all times especially when travelling at night as it has come to their attention that thugs are allegedly placing sharp objects on the road surface in the Pienaarsrivier area.
This causes damages to tyres forcing motorists to stop and subsequently being attacked and robbed. It was learnt that a motorist recently experienced substantial damage to his small sedan after a sharp object flung up and got stuck in his engine.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Police are aware of such incidents and warned motorists travelling at night to keep an eye out for objects in the road at all times.
“We have directed all stations along the N1 to monitor and patrol the N1 regularly and to check on motorists who might be having problems. The matter is being investigated and the Police are working around the clock to arrest perpetrators,” Mojapelo said.
He advised motorists to keep on driving if possible until they reached a safe and well-lit area to change a tyre.
