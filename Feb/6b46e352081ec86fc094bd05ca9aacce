A total of 75 Grade 1 learners were officially welcomed to Eagle’s Nest Christian School during the institution’s recent fourth annual bell ringing ceremony.
The custom was begun in 2017 by Grades 1 and 8 learners as a way of dedicating their hearts to God. The bell ringing ceremony will mark learners’ progress from Grade 1, when it marks the start of their formal education, to Grade 7 when they leave primary school and commence with secondary education and finally Grade 12 as they conclude their high school career.
Headmaster Mac van den Berg encouraged the learners to trust in God unequivocally, acknowledge Him in all their ways and love Him with their whole hearts.
