Baroka Football Club qualified for the quarter finals of the Nedbank Cup after beating ABC Motsepe outfit, Hungry Lions Football Club 4-2 on penalties at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday.
The Ga-Mphahlele based outfit are hopeful of repeating their amazing 2011 run they enjoyed in the competition when they reached the semi-finals of the tournament while campaigning in the Vodacom League.
The club’s head coach, Dylan Kerr said reaching the quarter finals will boost the morale of the team ahead of the last remaining fixtures of Premier Soccer League (PSL).

The club is currently in the 13th position of the league with 20 points after 22 matches and they need to win their matches to avoid relegation. “We are happy to have qualified for the quarterfinals. We are not doing well in the league and need to win matches like these. The winning culture and mentality is of necessity to us. We hope to get a home draw. We want to do well in the competition and make our supporters proud,” Kerr said.
Provided they continue in this form Baroka stands a chance of winning R7 million in prize money and an automatic qualification for the CAF Confederation Cup.
