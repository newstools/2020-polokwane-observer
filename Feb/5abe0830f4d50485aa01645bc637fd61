Head coach of the club Dylan Kerr said he was disappointed with the outcome of the match. “We are doing well in training, we are scoring goals but when it came to the match situation it is a different story. We created lot of chances throughout the match, we contained Wits and we were just unfortunate to concede a goal like that. We have eight matches to play for and we will do well,” Kerr said.
