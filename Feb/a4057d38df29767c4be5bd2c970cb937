Mitchell House hosted a workshop for support staff at the school’s theatre on Friday with colleagues from PEPPS as invited guests.
The main topic of the event was a presentation by Gerhard Lombard of the National Organisation of Employers South Africa (Noesa) with a focus on the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, highlighting matters that included the different leave benefit options for employees, remuneration of overtime and the definition of ordinary hours of work as defined in the act.
After lunch and a brief opportunity for networking, presentations on personal finances and basic fire and first aid procedures added to the programme.
