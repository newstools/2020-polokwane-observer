Residents can look forward to the screening of the movie “One night in Al-Aqsa” which is scheduled to take place at Northern Muslim School at 14:30 on Sunday.
One of the organisers Anisah Moosa indicated that the movie will be screened for a cause as all proceeds will be donated to projects aimed to assist victims and other people of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza.
A review on the internet describes the film as an awe-inspiring story of the Al-Aqsa Compound in Jerusalem set against the backdrop of the holiest night on the Islamic calendar. Al-Aqsa is one of the worlds most revered Islamic holy sites and remains shrouded in mystery. This is a place where miracles, that helped define the religion of Islam, took place. According to the review viewers can now, for the first time, experience the power of Al-Aqsa as told through the eyes of the people who live and work there.
“From the award winning director of One Day in The Haram and the Oscar nominated executive producer of The Look of Silence, Abrar Hussain comes a new vision, offering a unique look at both the spiritual history and the modern day workings of this most significant Islamic institution,” the review read.
The movie has an age restriction of 12 and tickets cost R150 per person. Tickets are available from Moosa on 082 646 0505 or Rabia Ismail on 072 608 7866.
