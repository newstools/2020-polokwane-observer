Ford had a strong start to the year as it ended January as the third best-selling automaker in South Africa.
Leading the automaker’s charge locally was the ever-popular Ranger bakkie, the EcoSport SUV, and the multi-talented Figo.
In an article by Wheels24 it is reported given that South Africans are showing a strong penchant for bakkies and SUVs, it’s good to see the Figo counting itself among Ford’s leading arsenal. In all, the Ranger sold 1 735 units last month, followed by the EcoSport on 1 132 units.
The Figo did well on finding 711 new owners, which is quite a feat considering it’s the first month of the year, and for a refreshed model that was launched locally almost two years ago.
The Figo has a sturdy reputation in South Africa, and in the B-segment. It’s one of the brand’s most trusted vehicles too, and the numbers are proof of that pudding. It’s no wonder that it’s still a go-to option.
The rest of Ford’s range, consisting of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (LCVs), include the big seven-seater Everest SUV (247 units), Fiesta (145 units), Kuga (76 units) and Tourneo (57 units).
The Mustang sports car sold an impressive 30 units last month, while the Focus could only muster one unit of its stock. It’s still rather sad that the model will no longer be sold locally, just as the super-spacious Fusion run came to an end a couple years ago.
