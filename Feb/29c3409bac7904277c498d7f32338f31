Disgruntled unemployed nurses affiliated to the Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union in the province and as far as Gauteng and Free State are currently gathered outside the Department of Health as they await MEC Phophi Ramathuba to collect their memorandum of grievances as part of a lunchtime march to the departmental headquarters. The group of more than 500 nurses is, among others, demanding the MEC’s removal.
The protesters refuse to hand over copies of the memorandum to the Chief Director for Human Resource Development, Mikateko Tlakulo saying they demand Ramathuba’s attention.
Angry nurses have threatened to blockade the entrances in College Street until Ramathuba arrives at the department. According to departmental spokesperson, Neil Shikwambana, the MEC is currently attending the African National Congress Lekgotla in Bela-Bela.
In an interview with Polokwane Observer the union’s President, Lerato Madumo stressed that over 450 nurses who were trained by the department are left jobless by the ‘childish’ MEC who only cares about her family and friends. She further claimed there were a lot of ghost employees at the department and reiterated that the money paid to ghost employees should be used to instead pay nurses.
Madumo concluded by saying they would continue fighting until their demands are met and Ramathuba is removed from her position as she mentioned that they must give her a position that has to do with plants and not human lives.
