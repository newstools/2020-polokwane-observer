Salome Ledwaba (49), a company secretary at Gateway Airport Authority Limited (Gaal) appeared in the Polokwane Magistrateâ€™s Court on Friday after she was arrested at her home in the city the previous evening for allegedly conspiring to have her husband killed.
According to Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke she is expected to appear in court again on 10 February for a formal bail application.
Maluleke indicated that Ledwaba, who is also a former senior manager at Capricorn District Municipality is allegedly experiencing marital problems and reportedly solicited the help of hitmen to kill her husband in exchange for a R50 000 payment.
Through intelligence gathering, the Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit uncovered the plot and immediately put a plan to action to apprehend Ledwaba, it was learnt.
Maluleke said investigations revealed that Ledwaba is married to a well-known businessman who also resides around Polokwane and that the couple is on the verge of a divorce. His identity is being protected.
