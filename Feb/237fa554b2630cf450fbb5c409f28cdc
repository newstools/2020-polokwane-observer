More than 30 job seekers who usually seek possible employment at the corner of Webster and Grobler streets were treated to bread and a cup of nutritious soup on Sunday.
The Good Samaritan was 2020 Miss Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club Limpopo finalist, Lesego Matheba who, through her social outreach programme brought some hope and comfort to these persons.
Matheba, a Pharmacy student at the University of Limpopo said with the gesture she wanted to give hope the myriads of job seekers. “I am an advocate for humanitarian acts, and I find satisfaction in helping people. I live in Flora Park and I see them every day sitting there despondently and waiting for that one opportunity. It is frustrating for an adult to be constantly unsuccessful in finding a job. This same stress is now commonly dominant among the youth of South Africa and it brings emotional trauma and suicidal thoughts.”
“I decided to take this initiative to shed light to what seemed like a dark day in their everyday life of being hopeful to secure a job. It is our duty as South Africans to constantly add hope to everyone who is facing this dark cloud. A little really does go a long way, just assuring someone that you do see them trying and that things will eventually be okay can totally uplift someone’s spirit and gage their energy,” Matheba remarked.
One of the job seekers, Lekau Kolobe thanked Matheba for her act of generosity. “We come here every day in the morning hoping that someone would come to our aid and sometimes there is nothing at all. Some of the job seekers carry lunch packs but some have nothing at all. We are grateful to her for reaching out to us. We enjoyed the meal and we wish her the best in her future aspirations.”
