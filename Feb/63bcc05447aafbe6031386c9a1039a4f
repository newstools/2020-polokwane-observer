Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba is calling on community members who might be having information to assist the Police to swiftly apprehend suspect(s) who hijacked a Toyota Quantum ambulance in Ga-Nachabeleng village in Strydkraal area yesterday (Wednesday) night.
According to information shared by departmental spokesperson Neil Shikwambana, the ambulance was returning to Nchabeleng Emergency Medical Service (EMS) station after transporting a patient to Jane Furse Hospital. He went on to indicate that the ambulance was later found stripped for parts at Ga Masemola in the early hours of this morning (Thursday) and added that the medical crew was also recovered safe but robbed of their cell phones.
Ramathuba was quoted to have said: “It is unfathomable how a sane person can target such a valuable and sensitive community resource like an ambulance. Doesn’t anyone care that a community member, a relative or even a parent or sibling can be hijacked and stripped for parts? What have we become as a society? We are pleading with anyone who might know something to come forward and assist the Police so that the suspects can be arrested.”
Annually, the department procures 50 ambulances to beef up its fleet but the impact is minimal due to theft and hijacking, Ramathuba explained and added that if it is not theft or hijacking of ambulances, it is nurses and guards at clinics who are targeted by these criminals which then thwarts department’s effort to render an effective 24-hour services.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the incident and indicated that the Police are investigating a case of hijacking. He stressed that investigations were underway and arrests were expected to be made soon.
