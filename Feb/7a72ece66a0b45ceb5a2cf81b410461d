Local soccer sensation, Nakedi Chipu has landed his first professional contract and on Friday signed a one and a half year deal with Sporting Clube de Espinho in Portugal with the option of renewal.
The-21-year old midfielder from Senwabarwana started playing football at Polokwane United Football Club in 2014.
He said his move to Portugal will advance his football career. “It has always been my dream to play abroad and I am happy to realise that dream. I have been working hard throughout the years and I cannot wait to play my first match for them,” Chipu said.
His former coach and mentor, Bally Smart said Chipu’s move to Portugal will inspire other young soccer players in the province.
“He was one of the most hardworking, disciplined and committed players at Polokwane United and wish him well in his new chapter,” Smart said.
