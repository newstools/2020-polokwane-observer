National retailer Clicks withdrew all TRESemmé products from its shelves following last week’s closure of more than 300 stores countrywide by the EFF in protest to a hair advertisement.
Locally, Clicks Mall of the North, Cycad Centre, Thornhill, Limpopo Mall, Savannah Mall and Circle Centre were forcibly closed by members of the party last Monday, while the branch at Cycad was also damaged.
A resolution between the EFF and Clicks was reached late last week, which included the withdrawal of TRESemmé products, the donation of 50 000 sanitary towels, masks and sanitiser to rural settlements identified by the EFF, and the awarding of five scholarships to students who wish to pursue pharmaceutical qualifications in the next academic year.
The EFF has vowed to assist law enforcement officials in ensuring that those responsible for vandalising Clicks stores be brought to book.
