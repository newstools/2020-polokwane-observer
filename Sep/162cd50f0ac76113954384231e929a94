Members of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 and the Rotary Anns prepared and distributed nearly 400 cheese burgers to residents on Friday in order to generate money to donate to deserving institutions such as Our Home/Ons Tuiste.
Some of the ingredients for the burgers were donated and the Anns started to prepare some of the components as early as last Thursday evening while the Rotarians had their virtual club meeting.
The President of the Anns, Charlie Vorster said that it was impossible to host the club’s annual fund-raising events such as the Oktoberfest and the charity golf day as a result of the pandemic and that other means had to be found to raise funds for donation to the club’s annual beneficiaries. “The relaxation of the restrictions to level two has created some opportunities that we will pursue and has also allowed the Anns to enjoy fellowship while maintaining the protocol of Covid-19 prevention,” Vorster said.
