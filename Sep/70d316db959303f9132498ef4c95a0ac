The deceased, Lizette and Hettie were attacked and abducted from their townhouse in Welgelegen on Thursday afternoon. A manhunt was launched, police gave chase and one suspect was forced off the road along the R37 road between Polokwane and Lebowakgomo. The suspect fled on foot and the bodies of the women were found in the vehicle. Both women had sustained several stab wounds.
Amid and his co-accused, Mudau were arrested on Sunday, in Mookgophong and Polokwane, respectively.  Today in court they were remanded in custody and their case postponed to Friday, 25 September.
