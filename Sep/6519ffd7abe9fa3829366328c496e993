“Open the athletics track at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.” This is the plea of local athletics coach, Deon Jewaskiewitz.
He trains and nurtures aspiring athletes from various parts of the province, who want to make use of the track to prepare for their upcoming events. Jewaskiewitz feels they are left in limbo due to the unavailability of the facility.
“I have seven athletes who have qualified for the national athletics event and they need to use the track to train. We currently train on the road, but this is not the same as the track because most of these athletes are short distance runners.”
Jewaskiewitz said they have submitted a letter to the Polokwane Municipality to request to make use of the facility. He said they are still waiting for a response.
“I also have athletes who are based in rural communities and they rely on the facility to advance their careers. They do not have any training facilities in their respective communities and solely rely on the track at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.”
He said they are unsure why athletes are not allowed to use the track. “Soccer matches are being played at the stadium but athletes cannot use the track,” Jewaskiewitz said.
The Polokwane Municipality Spokesperson, Thipa Selala, could not be reached for comment by the time of going to press.
