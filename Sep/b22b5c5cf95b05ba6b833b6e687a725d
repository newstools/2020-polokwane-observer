Palesa Mogoboya is taking advantage of clients’ sweet tooth.
The 17-year-old sells ice creams with a creative twist under her Candyland business. She inherited the business from her uncle who started it after seeing a post on social media advertising similar ice creams at exorbitant prices. “This was 10 weeks ago and we decided there and then that we can give customers good quality ice cream at affordable prices,” she said.
The Hoërskool Noorderland learner said that she has gladly accepted the challenge of building on the idea that her uncle conceptualised. The major challenge she currently faces is finding a balance between school and running the business, especially after the effects of the lockdown on the school workload. She gets plenty of help from her family to make the business a success. “My uncle does the ordering of supplies we need; he also does the deliveries. My mother helps with managing the finances and my aunt assists with marketing and liaising with customers,” she explained.
The ice cream is available in very berry, chocolate mess, oreo delight, pink blush and their customer favourite, caramel fudge. She is excited about what the future holds because the business has received overwhelming support since it started. “The people of Polokwane have really come through and overwhelmed us with their support. We are only looking to grow the business bigger and better from this point on,” she added. She further thanked everyone who has supported her by sharing their posts on social media, they receive a cup of Candyland ice cream for free.
