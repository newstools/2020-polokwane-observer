POLOKWANE – The Mike Tauyatswala branch of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) participated in a national Memorial Day for frontline workers, this afternoon.
The main event was held at Baragwanath Hospital in Gauteng but provincially, the day was celebrated with an event at the Pietersburg Provincial Hospital. Pastor Tommy Kgomo led the congregation in prayer.  
Polokwane Observer spoke to Nehawu’s Provincial Secretary, Jacob Adams, who emphasised the purpose of the day which was organised to remember frontline workers who succumbed to Covid-19.


“We remember those who have passed on and show our support to those who are still on the frontline. We also want to highlight the issue of occupational health and safety protocols which are not adhered to by employers,” Adams said.
