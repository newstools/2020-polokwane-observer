Limpopo Aquatics swimmers finally got back into the swimming pool last week and started with their training programmes. According to vice-president, Rob Anderson, this is in preparation for future competitions and swimming events.
“There are no competitions on the horizon, but we are happy to see all our swimmers return to their swimming lanes after a five- month break due to the lockdown.”
Anderson stated that the lack of competitions is a challenge for professional swimmers, as they need to have times on their database.
“This is a difficult period for top swimmers because most of them are pushing for university bursaries and scholarships and they need to set new times for themselves in order to get those bursaries.”
He said their Polokwane-based swimmers train at Hoërskool Pietersburg’s swimming pool.
“We usually use the Polokwane Municipality’s swimming pool but we do not currently have access due to the lockdown. We are happy that the swimmers are able to train and we will ensure that all swimmers maintain social distancing and adhere to all Covid-19 protocols during the training sessions.”
