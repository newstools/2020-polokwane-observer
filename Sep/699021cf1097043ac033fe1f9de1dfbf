Polokwane Municipality has received 625 amnesty applications of which 125 are from residents of Annadale.
This comes after the municipality opened up an amnesty period from July to August for residents who have illegally connected either water or electricity to come forward and disclose their illegal connections without the option of a fine.
Those who have come forward will have municipal technicians visit them at their addresses to verify the illegal activity declared by the applicants and correct the metering system. There will be no penalty fees imposed against the customer.
Municipal Spokesperson, Thipa Selala, says if a customer is found to have connected illegally after the amnesty period has ended, the municipality will terminate their services and impose a minimum penalty of R70 000 for residential consumers and R150 000 for business. “In these cases the municipality also has the option of laying criminal charges.”
According to Selala the municipality is satisfied with the number of applications it has received.
