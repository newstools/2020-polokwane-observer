Project124 is a business and entrepreneurship training platform that is giving local entrepreneurs the opportunity to learn from seasoned industry experts from various countries.
The programme gives entrepreneurs from South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Eswatini and Zambia exposure to business leaders and the opportunity to build globally competitive entrepreneurs through the Project124 experience, and be connected to potential investors, business partners and lifetime mentors. The theme for this year is ‘Accelerating Entrepreneurs Towards Better Futures’. The participants will be able to tune in online to attend and participate in these training sessions through the Project124 Immersion Week, explained Mahlogonolo Takalo, programme leader responsible for introducing the initiative to South Africa.
This year, 23 young entrepreneurs from Limpopo will participate and the focus has been mainly on township and rural entrepreneurs in need of coaching and mentoring. The itinerary for Project124 this year includes the Project124 Entrepreneurship Conference 2020 which took place on 29 August, the Project124 Immersion Week, from 1 to 12 September, the Entrepreneurship Bootcamps is in the last two weeks of September, and the Project124 Africa finals on 17 October.
Matshipi Thoobejane, CEO and founder of Moloto Films is one of the entrepreneurs from Polokwane taking part.
He decided to register because there are skills and knowledge that he needs to run his business: “I found it very important to become part of Project124 because there are experienced and professionals in business that are sharing valuable skills and knowledge that will assist me to grow my business”.
