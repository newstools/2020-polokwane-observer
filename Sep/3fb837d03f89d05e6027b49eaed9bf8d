In Polokwane more than 100 people in bakkies, vehicles and motorbikes drove in a convoy from Thornhill Shopping Centre at 10:00 on Saturday. They were mostly dressed in black with posters ‘Hoot for change’ written on it. They all formed part of the Move one Million movement that took place across South Africa and in other countries around the globe.
Residents in the city witnessed a slow-drive peaceful protest against corruption and all forms of brutality in the country and abroad. The movement, Move one Million, was launched earlier this year with the aim to encourage at least one million South Africans, locally and internationally, to unite. It was founded by Jarette Petzer and Joanita van Wyk.
One of the participants, Lize Botha, and her family joined the event. “It is important to stand together as a nation. I teach this to my children and every other person I am in contact with.”
