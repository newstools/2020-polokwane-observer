One of the organisers of the protest, Adele van der Linde, earlier told Review that she was heartbroken when she heard the news this morning.

“I am tired. I usually accompany the MEC on visits where women were murdered, sometimes by random and other times by people they knew or loved. This was the final straw for me and it is time that we do something. Some people are asking me ‘why now?’, and I tell them; ‘Why not now?’,” Van der Linde said.
Polokwane Observer spoke to Elsie Grobler who asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to take action against the killings of women.

The women were stabbed to death on Thursday, the police confirmed earlier this morning. “The bodies of the women were found with several stab wounds, and their hands had been tied. The vehicle was found abandoned along the R37, next to the Kushcke off-ramp, following a high density search operation that was launched soon after the attack,” said Police Spokesperson, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo.
Two murder cases and one of robbery have been opened.
Even though the motive for the murders is unknown at this stage, robbery cannot be ruled out, he confirmed.
Anyone with information is requested to contact Colonel Linkie Mathebula on 064 756 8218 or 0860010111.
