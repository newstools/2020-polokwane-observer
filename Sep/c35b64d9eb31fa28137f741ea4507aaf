Passersby on the corner of Bulawayo and Witklip Street were yesterday morning witness to the scene where the body of a newborn was discovered next to a garbage bin.
A waste picker, who opted to remain anonymous, said as was his routine, he went through the rubbish, but soon realised a foul smell eminating from a black refuse bag next to the bin.
“When I opened the bag the first thing I saw was a tiny foot and an umbilical cord. The baby was already dead by the time I found it.”
He subsequently alerted petrol attendants who work nearby and soon a crowd gathered.
Fuel station Manager Koos Mokgoatsane says he was not present when the incident took place, but they will provide security video footage to assist the police in their investigation to find the person responsible.
Westenburg Police Station Commander Maimele Pilusa says the station is investigating a case of concealment of birth.
Micheal Burning, a homeless man who usually sleeps on the premises, says he first saw the plastic bag on Tuesday but did not think to open it as he is not a waste picker.
“This morning I was just sitting here when I saw a waste picker calling out after he opened the bag. I personally feel that it was not necessary to dump the baby, even if it had died during birth. There are always better alternatives than dumping an unwanted baby.”
Burning says his heart “broke” when he saw it.
“It is inhumane to dump a baby when so many people want to have children.”
Department of Social Development Spokesperson, Witness Tiva has urged individuals who do not want to keep their babies to consider alternatives offered by the department.
“The department is working with non-government organisation Ngwana House to help mothers who want to place their children up for adoption.
“We urge mothers to consider taking their children there or contacting social workers for an assessment whereafter they will be assisted based on the options available to them.”
