Former Polokwane City Football Club goalkeeper, Dino Visser, signed with the English Football League Two as part of the Port Vale Club last week.
The Polokwane-born goalkeeper started playing football at Mitchell House and Stanford Lake College from 2002 to 2006 and joined several South African born players plying their trade in Europe.
He signed his first professional football contract with Platinum Stars Football Club in 2011.
He then moved to Bloemfontein Celtic Football Club in 2012 where he won the Telkom Knockout Cup with the club.
The 31-year-old goal minder returned to his birth place in the 2014/15 Premier Soccer League season to join Polokwane City Football Club where he played in more than 20 matches.
Dino’s father, Stephen Visser said he was happy to see his son fulfilling his childhood dream. “This is a dream move for him. He has been a professional soccer player for ten years and he has contributed a lot to South African football. It is unfortunate that he was not getting enough support in the country and he was not credited enough. He is happy with the recognition he is getting in Europe, they rate him highly there and he is looking forward to the new season.”
