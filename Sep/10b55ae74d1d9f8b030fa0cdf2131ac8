Members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers Unionâ€™s (Nehawu) Mike Tautswala branch in Limpopo have threatened to down tools if their demands are not met by 10 September.
Mike Tauyatswala branch representatives last Thursday handed over a memorandum of demands to the Premier, Chupu Mathabatha.
Among others, they demand full compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act in all places of work, and that proper risk assessments, and control and prevention measures are put in place.
In terms of Covid-19, they demand that infected workers must return to work given stipulations they highlighted in the memorandum.
They furthermore called on the National Department of Health to issue a circular that prohibits managers from issuing communicating of any kind that suggests that workers, who have been in contact with Covid-19 patients, or who themselves have tested positive for the virus but are asymptomatic, are compelled to work.
The list of demands further states that the Department of Health must engage with the Health Professions Council of South Africa to expedite applications and review postponed arrangements for the board exams for foreign trained doctors and other healthcare workers.
Other demands include a risk allowance for frontline workers; and the procurement and provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline workers.
Nehawu Provincial Secretary, Jacob Adams said government has seven days to respond to the issues listed, after which members will down tools if no satisfactory action had been taken. The premier acknowledged receipt of the memorandum.
