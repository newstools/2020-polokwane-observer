The murder of the two women last night sent shockwaves through the city.
Lizette Deacon was a prominent businesswoman and much-loved figure in several circles.
According to Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, the police’s Provincial Communications Head, a manhunt has been launched for those responsible for the murders.
“The bodies of the women were found with several stab wounds, and their hands had been tied. The vehicle was found abandoned along the R37, next to the Kushcke off-ramp, following a high density search operation that was launched soon after the attack.”

According to sources on the scene from the townhouse they stay in at Welgelegen, the two women have been abducted and a vehicle is also missing.

A source close to the situation who was supposed to meet one of the woman earlier today, confirmed that he went to the townhouse after she didn’t pitch for their appointment, and he found the townhouse to be in a shambles.
None of the women could be reached on their phones since around 17:00. According to an inside source, the vehicle is currently being tracked.
