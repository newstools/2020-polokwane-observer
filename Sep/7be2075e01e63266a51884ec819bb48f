The encouragement to participate in sport resulted in Karabo Kataka falling in love with netball.
The 17-year-old has been playing netball for 12 years now and was introduced to the sport in primary school when a teacher encouraged her to select a sport.
“I chose netball and eventually fell in love with it,” she explained.
She plays for the first team at Capricorn High School and for the Young Fighters Netball Club’s u/19 team.
Netball is currently taking a back seat while the country waits for restrictions to be lifted, but she has not stopped with her personal training and keeping fit.
“This pandemic has made it impossible for us to constantly train and practice for future games because of the regulations that are in place. We used to train as a team and it involves being close to one another so we understand why it is prohibited for now,” she said.
She has incorporated various sporting activities into her lifestyle. One of her biggest indulges is reading. She shared that she loves fine literature and that is how she passes her free time.
She said she is more than ready to get back to sport full-time, adding that it does not disrupt her school work.
