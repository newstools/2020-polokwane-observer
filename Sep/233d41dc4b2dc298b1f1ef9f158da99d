After several months since the nationwide lockdown was implemented, Zanis Gymnastics Academy re-opened its doors in Polokwane, Tzaneen and Vivo on 31 August and will soon open in Hoedspruit as well.
“All Covid-19 safety precautions and policies are in place with safety certificates received from the South African Gymnastics Federation.
“Zanis will do everything in their power to keep gymnasts safe at the gym with sanitiser all over the venue and gymnasts and coaches wearing socks and masks during training sessions.
The gym will be sanitised after each session and groups are much smaller,” says owner and head coach, Zani Prinsloo.
Although gymnasts were housebound it did not mean less practice as the club hosted two separate Zoom challenges.
“It has been great to keep the gymnasts active and involved during the lockdown,” Zani added.
For the month of August, Zanis launched a second Zoom challenge for all the gymnastics disciplines namely preschool, artistic, trampoline and rhythmic.
Winners received a Zanis Zoom chocolate cake while runners-up and second runners-up received Zanis medals.
Zani thanked all parents and gymnasts for their continued loyal support.
