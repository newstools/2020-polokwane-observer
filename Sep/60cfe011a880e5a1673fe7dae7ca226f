Residents of Mohlakaneng and all phases of Luthuli Park will no longer have to travel long distances to catch a taxi to the city.
This comes after the completion of the upgrades of Polokwane Drive popularly known as the old Seshego road.
The road was closed in October 2018 for a face-lift and was expected to be completed within a year.
The delays have prompted commuters in Mohlakaneng and Luthuli Park to travel 7 km to the circle centre to take a taxi.
Spokesperson for Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo said the road is complete and will open for motorists on 25 September.
“The contractors are finalising the paving next to the road, markings and some of the road signs.”
Mothapo further stated that the upgrades were aimed at increasing the capacity of Polokwane Drive and enable it to handle traffic coming into and going out of the Seshego Circle hub.
“We also want to improve the capacity of Polokwane Drive as an alternative link between Seshego and the CBD, as well as the proposed new hubs at Seshego Junction and Makgathoville (via Madiba Park Street),” Mothapo concluded.
