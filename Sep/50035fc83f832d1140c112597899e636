A little goes a long way.
This expression is used to describe situations when just a little bit of something can have a huge impact.
One such example is when the Round Table Pietersburg 22 launched the project, Add a two Rand to make a difference. Club members were stationed at Cycad Centre on Thursday, 27 August and gave shoppers at Pick n Pay, a R2 donation and asked them to buy non-perishable food items.
Round Table Pietersburg 22 vice-chairperson, Gerhard Booysen explained that the coins were donated by Rose Assistants.
“We asked shoppers to use the coin to buy food.
“Some shoppers came back with food items and also returned the coin,” he said.
Various non-perishable food items, such as rice, samp and sugar were bought and on Friday, 28 August, the food was donated to the SAVF Martha Hofmeyr Tehuis.
Beatrice Loots, secretary of Service Management for SAVF Polokwane, told Polokwane Observer the food will come in handy and save them a lot of money.
“We are delighted and thankful for Round Table Pietersburg 22. Everything that is in the shopping bag is going to be very useful and helpful towards every resident who lives here. We are grateful for their help and words cannot describe how happy and grateful we feel about the donation,” Loots said.
Booysen said the project was a huge success.
“We would like to thank the community, Pick n Pay Family Cycad Centre and Rose Assistants for their participation in the project. We would not have been able to to do it without everyone’s support,” said Booysen.
