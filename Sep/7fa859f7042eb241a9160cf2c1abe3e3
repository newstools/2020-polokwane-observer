Women and men of the city gathered outside the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court this morning, where the four accused in the murder of local Ocean Basket owner, Lizette Deacon, and her mother, Hettie are appearing.
The gathering is part of a planned march against gender-based violence (GBV), organised by the Women’s Movement.

According to the Spokesperson for the movement, Thabiso Mampuru, the organisation is non-racial, non-discriminatory and caters for women of all walks of life. “We are all mothers, daughters, rich, poor, housewives, businesswomen and domestic workers and we are looking for ordinary and phenomenal women to take a stand with us. We have decided enough is enough, and we are not going to wait until another woman or child has been murdered, raped or gone missing.”
Mampuru added the movement will be taking back residents’ safety by working along with law enforcement, Community Policing Forums (CPF), political organisations and government departments to practically deal with crime and ensure safety. She also called on men to join them in the fight against GBV.
Polokwane Observer spoke to one of the women at the protest, who says she fears for the safety of herself as well as her children. “I grew up in Polokwane and used to walk to malls with my friends without the worry of being kidnapped. The fact that the city is so unsafe, I have decided to stand up against GBV and let my voice be heard.”
