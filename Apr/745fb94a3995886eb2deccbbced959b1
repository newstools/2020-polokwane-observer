The Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (Ledet) has warned against
an undisclosed number of crocodiles which have recently strayed from a registered breeding facility at Roossenekal in Sekhukhune.
Information issued by departmental spokesperson Zaid Kalla indicated that MEC Thabo Mokone has since dispatched a team of environmental officers to the area to assist in urgently containing the situation and where need be, forcefully defend the lives of affected community members.
The crocodiles have been spotted along Steelport River, Kalla stated and reiterated that residents are urged to approach the river with caution.
Mokone has reportedly indicated that the lockdown measures have played a part in saving the lives of community members residing near the breeding facility.
According to Mokone, environmental officers deployed in the area will play a key role in ensuring that the animals are isolated and if need be, permanently so.
