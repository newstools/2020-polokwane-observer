A handful of suspects will have to spend Easter weekend behind bars after three of them were arrested following a reported attempted hijacking in Devenish Street yesterday (Thursday) and a fourth was apprehended along the N1 outside Polokwane for allegedly being in possession of a stolen vehicle earlier this afternoon.
Following yesterday’s incident a source indicated that they received a report about an alleged attempted hijacking in Devenish Street.
It was learnt that Crime fighters of Mighty Tactical Reaction Service reportedly kept a close eye on the suspects moving on foot and with SPS High Risk Unit and members of the Polokwane Police’s Tekkie Squad mobilised and clamped down on the suspects. One was arrested on the spot while two others were later apprehended in a shop in the city, according to the source.
Members of the same crime fighting units also intercepted an alleged stolen bakkie on the N1 just outside the city earlier today.
More details about the incident and the origin of the vehicle are not available at this stage.
