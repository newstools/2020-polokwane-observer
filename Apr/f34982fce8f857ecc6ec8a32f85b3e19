Recognising the effect of the lockdown measures on people in need, members of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 are delivering food and essential items to old age homes and institutions on a continuous basis.
Surplus fruit and vegetables that are donated by Marlo Farms outside the city were collected by the Rotarians earlier today (Wednesday) and tomatoes, peppers and bags of mushrooms were delivered to Our Home/Ons Tuiste, Centenary House and Vergeet-my-nie Behuisingsentrum as well as Vision of Hope and shelters and other facilities caring for people in need around the city.
Yesterday (Tuesday) Rotarians Fred and Anni Hurter also delivered food parcels to the Cansa TLC Centre at the Paediatric Oncology Ward of Pietersburg Hospital to be taken home by parents collecting children after treatment at the facility.
