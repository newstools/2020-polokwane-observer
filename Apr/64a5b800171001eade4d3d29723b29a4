Following the last two weeks’ panic buying, it appears that shopping patterns in retail outlets where food and essential items were sold, started to calm down during the weekend.
Pick n Pay Cycad reported a huge increase in turnover from just before the announcement of the lockdown until this weekend but this morning (Monday) it became clear that most shoppers have stocked up for the immediate future and are now only visiting the shop to buy when really necessary. According to managing director of Pick n Pay Cycad, Hannes van den Heever, this retailer’s offer to accept E-mailed shopping lists for delivery, had to be terminated on Friday due to overwhelming demand. “We do not have the logistical capacity to deal with the activity and will in future only offer this service to pensioners and old age homes,” Van den Heever said and apologised for any inconvenience caused.
At Spar Platinum Park business peeked during the last two weeks and queues of shoppers were observed outside the entrances waiting to be admitted after their hands and trolleys were sanitised. Business was also slower since after the weekend.
At FreshStop at Caltex Ivy Park and Food Lover’s Market in Thornhill Shopping Centre, there was a remarkable slowing down since the weekend. “The second and third week of every month are traditionally quieter than the first and last weeks of every month and this could also have been a contributing factor,” a retailer said.
