Police are investigating cases of rape, murder, attempted murder and house robbery after an incident that occurred at Mawoni Village in the Mphephu area early yesterday (Tuesday) morning.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that two sisters, aged 39 and 29 years, were allegedly attacked, robbed of three cell phones, cash and reportedly raped by three unknown suspects while sleeping in their parental house in the village.
Members of the community were alerted, mobilised and started to search for the possible suspects involved in the matter. In the process, two of the three suspects were cornered and caught by the mob in one of the villages, according to Ngoepe.
He added that they then allegedly assaulted them with an assortment of weapons including stones and set one of the suspects alight.
When Police arrived on the scene the charred remains of a middle aged man was found as well as a 24-year-old man who was critically injured. The injured man was taken to a nearby hospital.
Ngoepe further indicated that the injured suspect will appear in the Mphephu Magistrateâ€™s Court as soon as he recovers from hospital.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba condemned the killing as well as the attempted killing of the second suspect.
He warned community members to refrain from taking the law into their own hands as they will be dealt with mercilessly and without compromise.
Anyone with information is requested to contact investigating officer Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or report to the nearest Police station.
