A batch of 150 masks produced by the women of Polokwane through sponsorships from local business and the ongoing initiative steered by Shabier Valjie of Mighty Tactical Reaction Service and Jason Janse van Rensburg of SPS was handed to a contingent of law enforcers prior to embarking on todayâ€™s undercover crackdown in Polokwane.
The masks were handed out by Suraiya Essa who is coordinating the ongoing mask-making project from Nirvana.
Since the announcement of the national lockdown drop-offs of masks, gloves, sanitisers and water have been made at roadblocks across Polokwane for Police and traffic officials in the frontline.
