The show must go on amidst the restriction of gatherings of more than 100 people and members of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 decided to remain active in order to serve the community and maintain oversight over the projects that are ongoing by embracing the 4th industrial revolution.
The club’s weekly meetings that are scheduled for every Thursday evening at the Polokwane Bowls Club have been suspended for the duration of the lock down and the club members have realised that they can not compromise their weekly fellowship. “I have therefore taken the opportunity to open a meeting group on Zoom to enable our meetings to continue,” President of the club, Horst Meyer said after the meeting that took place yesterday (Thursday) evening.
The meeting on social media has now become so popular that some members even requested that the meetings should be held more often. “I miss my friends and this platform really provides an opportunity to socialise in the comfort of our own homes and support one another in this trying times, Rotarian Mike Human said and added that the Rotarians are a sincere group of friends who use this platform to check on one another on a continuous basis.
