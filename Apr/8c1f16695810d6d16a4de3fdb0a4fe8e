MEC for Health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba and Transport and Community Safety MEC, Mavhungu Lerule Ramakhanya are expected to visit Sinthumule Kutama Correctional Service outside Louis Trichardt later today (Monday) as part of monitoring compliance of the Covid-19 rules and regulations.
In a press statement issued by the relevant departmentsâ€™ Spokespersons the aim of the visit is not only to monitor compliance but to also conduct mass screening and testing on inmates and employees at the facility.
The screening and testing programme was launched in the province by Premier Chupu Mathabatha in Lephalale recently. The departments have noted that inmates and officials are the most vulnerable because of the environment they are in and that adherence to Covid-19 rules and regulations remains pivotal. Screening and testing remain important tools to assist in collating Covid-19 information that will be useful to the epidemiologist in the analysis of the pandemic, it was stated.
The MECs remain confident that through the process of mass screening and testing the departments will be able to receive real Covid-19 statistics across the province and further called on communities to cooperate with community health care workers and health professionals who will be visiting homes for screening and testing.
