President Cyril Ramaphosa together with Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize and Premier Stan Mathabatha visited the two Zion Christian Churches (ZCCs) yesterday (Sunday) for consultative meetings and to thank them for halting Good Friday and Easter pilgrimages.
In footage made available to Polokwane Observer, Ramaphosa is heard saying they came to visit the two ZCC churches and they were well received by the Bishops, Engenas Lekganyane of St Engenas ZCC and Barnabas Lekganyane of ZCC. He indicated that they visited the two congregations largely to thank them for the support they are giving to the government and the nation and also the decisions that they have taken not to go ahead with the Good Friday and Easter celebrations.
“We came to brief them about the processes that we are involved in as government in terms of dealing with the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. We also came to hear what thoughts, proposals and advises that they have to offer. We will be seeing a large number of other leaders as we go through this moment of a lockdown. We still need to extend our consultations and brief people and formations. This visit was informative which also saw Mkhize and Mathabatha briefing the Bishops at a close range on a number of things we are doing as government to deal with the virus,” Ramaphosa concluded.
