Limpopo has as of yesterday (Thursday) registered its 19th Coronavirus (Covid-19) case and this is due to, according to Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba, a lack of discipline from people when they are told to self-isolate.
In footage made available to Polokwane Observer, Ramathuba can be heard saying the department has seen an increase in a number of cases registered in the province: “We are now at 19 and the main concern is a number of local transmissions we are beginning to see in Limpopo and most importantly is that these are the spouses or close family members of those who have travelled outside the province either for work purposes or have been staying outside the province or have travelled overseas,” she explained.
Ramathuba reiterated that the department has taken a resolution to self-isolate anyone who has tested positive for the virus. She added that they have noted that people were not disciplined enough to self-isolate when healthcare workers tell them to do so. According to her, the decision by the department to self-isolate those who have tested positive have been received with mixed emotions and feelings from a number of people.
Ramathuba stressed that the only way Limpopo can beat and defeat this enemy is through isolation, quarantine, testing and screening. She concluded by saying Limpopo can win the battle against this invisible enemy if residents put in a lot of effort in the aforementioned aspects.
