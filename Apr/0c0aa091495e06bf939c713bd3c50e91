The House of Traditional Leaders in Limpopo has suspended 2020 initiation schools season due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus.
Chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders in Limpopo, Malesela Dikgale said the decision was taken during their meeting with Premier Stan Mathabatha last week.
The House had already received 329 000 applications from various traditional leaders in the province to run initiation schools set for June and July. “The Coronavirus frustrated us. It affected our plans and preparations for the programme in a bad way. We were just about to finalise permits but we were unable to perform that duty because of the outbreak.”
Dikgale also appealed to all citizens to adhere to the regulations of the Lockdown stressing that together they can fight the pandemic. “We are urging members of the community to sanitise, maintain social distance and wash their hands regularly in order to flatten the curve and curb the outbreak of the virus,” Dikgale said.
