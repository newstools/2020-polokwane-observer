Close to 25 suspects have thus far been arrested during an ongoing undercover operation in Polokwane as they were caught red-handed contravening the Disaster Management Act amid the lockdown.
The operation has brought together the Police, the SANDF, security concerns Mighty Tactical Reaction Service and National Security, crime fighters & breakdown services in the city.
While Polokwane is mostly bolted up, scores of residents are out stocking up on essentials.
Earlier this morning (Saturday) a chain store manager downtown was warned against allegedly selling non-essentials after a man taken in for buying a kick bike led the forces back to the shop.
