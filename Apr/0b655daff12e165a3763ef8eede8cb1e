Eight suspected employees of a spares shop in downtown Polokwane were among the close to 35 persons taken in for disregarding the rules of lockdown when crime fighters clamped down on hotspots across the city today (Tuesday).
The operation that initially got off to a slow start yielded results as those contravening the Disaster Management Act were rounded up in the city and surrounds.
The owner of the spares business was fined R13 000 after seven of the eight people suspected of being in his employ were discovered hiding at the back of the premises upon arrival of a large contingent of Police officials and representatives of security concerns Mighty Tactical Reaction Service, SPS High Risk Unit, National Security & Urban Africa Security at the location on Paul Kruger Street.
Despite documentation provided by staff members the business was seen not to be entitled to render an essential service during the period of lockdown.
