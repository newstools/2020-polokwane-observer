It is business as usual at major agricultural operations around the city and surrounds although strict measures are applied to safeguard workers as well as consumers against contamination with the Corona virus.
At Marlo Farms outside the city, the production process is affected by the restrictions imposed by the lockdown measures announced by government. “We have to support our clients on an ongoing basis and have amended our shift schedules to ensure that workers in every plant do not exceed the prescribed limit and we maintain social distancing and strict anti-contamination measures,” a manager at the farm said. He added that production schedules have also been adapted to demand of certain of the items produced on the farm.
At ZZ2 production also goes on as usual. Managing Director of ZZ2, Tommie van Zyl said on Facebook that the pandemic is causing unprecedented challenges globally. “We at ZZ2 are adhering to the lockdown regulations and continuing our operations to produce food as an essential service. Our protocols are focussed on sanitisation, social distancing, decreased physical interactions, compartmentalisation and strong focus on protocols to support people systematically as the crisis unfolds,” Van Zyl said.
