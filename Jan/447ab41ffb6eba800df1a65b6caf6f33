Swazi national Thabo Sibandze (27) suspected of being involved in the fatal shooting of Deputy Secretary of the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) in Limpopo Ronald Mani in Thoho­yandou in January 2019 is expected to appear in the local magistrate’s court next month after his arrest in December.
According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo the suspect appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on 30 December on a charge of murder.
Mani was shot several times on 30 January 2019 at a liquor outlet in Thohoyandou and died on the scene, Mojapelo reminded.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba then assembled a high level task team of investigators led by the Deputy Provincial Commissioner responsible for Crime Detection, Samuel Manala to track down the suspects.
It was found that Sibandze had been in custody for intimidation after he was arrested on 1 March 2019 in Vosloorus, Gauteng.
He was also charged under the Immigration Act as he did not possess the necessary documents to be in the country, according to Mojapelo.
The case of intimidation emanates from an incident in which a local councillor allegedly received intimidating calls from an unknown person and subsequently reported the matter to the Police.
Intense investigations revealed Sibandze’s alleged involvement in the killing of Mani. He was arrested and brought before the Thoho­yandou Magistrate’s Court where he was formally charged with the murder of Mani. Ledwaba commended the members for their sterling detective work which led to the arrest of the suspect.
