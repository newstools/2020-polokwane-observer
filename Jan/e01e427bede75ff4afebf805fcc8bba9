The embattled Baroka Football Club beat their nemesis Polokwane City Football Club 1-0 during a Limpopo Premier Soccer League (PSL) derby at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.
The feat sees Baroka moving from 15th to 13th position of the 2019/2020 PSL log while City are still last on the log.
The Ga-Mphahlele based outfit will be hoping to collect maximum points against Stellenbosch Football Club when the two meet for the 19th match of the PSL scheduled for Athlone Stadium in Cape Town tomorrow (Friday).
Both teams find themselves in the relegation zone and are in need of maximum points in order to stay afloat. Stellenbosch trashed Highlands Park Football Club 4-1 at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday to move from position 14 to 11 of the league.
Baroka’s Assistant Coach, Matsimela Thoka said their victory against City was a morale booster. “We had gone three PSL matches without success and we needed to win in order to lift our spirits.”
He described their match against Stellenbosch as a tricky affair.
“They also won over the weekend and they are not in a good position in the league, but we have a good record on the road and we will come back home with maximum points,” Thoka said.
