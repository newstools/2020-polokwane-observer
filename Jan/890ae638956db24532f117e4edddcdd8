Local soccer star, Kgaogelo Sekgota from Mmotong wa Perekisi village joined Premier Soccer League (PSL) giants Bidvest Wits Football Club on Friday.
Sekgota, formerly with ABC Motsepe League campaigners Polokwane United Academy signed a six months deal with the club.
Wits won the 2016-2017 PSL league title under multi award winning coach Gavin Hunt and is currently in 4th position of the league.
Sekgota said it has always been his dream to play in the elite league. “I have always wanted to work with a coach like Gavin Hunt. This was a big factor for me coming to Bidvest Wits. I grew up watching him winning trophies at SuperSport United and Wits. I became really excited when he expressed interest in signing me,” Sekgota said.
Sekgota initially moved to Lithuania back in March 2017 where he was voted young player of the month on a number of occasions. His performances attracted interest from a number of clubs across Europe but it was Vitoria Setubal that won his signature.
He signed for the Portuguese side in October 2018, making his debut in front of a packed Estadio Dragao against FC Porto. “Playing against FC Porto was a dream come true. I was really nervous but after I got a touch of the ball, I became calm. It was a special moment for me,” Sekgota remarked.
Sekgota made his Bidvest Wits debut against Cape Town City in the 2-0 defeat after coming on in the last 15 minutes with Wits chasing the game on Saturday.
His agent and mentor Bally Smart said Sekgotha’s move to Wits will help him to break into the Bafana Bafana set up. “Kgaogelo is a pacey, tricky winger who likes to take on players. His intensity is what sets him apart from other players.”
