Jabez Christian Academy’s Class of 2019, Ricardo Erasmus, Kgosi Tlolo, Brilliant Ramoadi and Innocent Njdovu passed their matric examinations with a total of three bachelors and one diploma passes. Kgosi also obtained a distinction in Mathematics Literacy.
Principal Elana Erasmus said that she was particularly pleased with the learners’ achievements in view of the fact that 2019 was also the tenth year that the school had matrics and that a 100% matric pass rate was sustained. “Smaller classes afford us more time to spend with learners and has proven to be an advantage,” Erasmus said. She also expressed her gratitude to the Almighty for blessing the school and for His faithfulness.
