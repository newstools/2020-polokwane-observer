Polokwane City Football Club beat Chippa United 2-0 in their 16th match of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.
City came into the match buoyed after going seven games without success. The Polokwane based outfit were in desperate need of points in order to move out of the relegation zone.
The newly appointed head coach, Clinton Larsen put a strong starting line-up that included the likes of Thando Mbooi, Puleng Tlolane, Mohammed Anas and Sibusiso Hlubi who were instrumental in the team’s successful attack.
The much needed feat sees them moving up from 15th to 12th position of the league with 16 points.
Larsen said he was pleased and that their victory against Chippa was a morale boost. “We needed the victory and the three points in order to move away from the relegation zone. It was a tough match but the boys gave their all,” Larsen said.
