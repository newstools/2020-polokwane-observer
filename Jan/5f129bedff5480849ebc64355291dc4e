PEPPS Preparatory School and College athletes not only used the schoolâ€™s inter-house meeting at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium last Thursday to test their fitness levels and aptitude but also to secure a spot in teams that will represent the school against other institutions during the new athletics season.
Athletes from Apollo, Poseidon and Zeus participated in a full programme of track and field items.
Although the results were not made available by the time of going to print, PEPPS College Headmaster Nelia de Beer and Executive Head Annabel Roberts indicated that the meeting was to prepare athletes for the independent schools athletics meeting scheduled for next Friday at Mitchell House and a small schools challenge set for 10 February at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.
They indicated that all the participants displayed talent and passion for athletics and that they were confident that the athletes would do them proud and represent the school well.
