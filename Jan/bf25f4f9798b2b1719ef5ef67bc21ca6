While a heavy rain storm raged outside his home last Tuesday afternoon, 96 year-old Westenburg resident Gabriel Knight’s joy was tangible when he accepted a brand new wheelchair from ANC ward councillor Hafiz Shaikh and ANC Winrainbow Branch Chairperson Mashimpye Stuurman.
Knight moved to Westenburg during 1980 and is currently the eldest resident of the suburb. He has been bedridden for the last year and has thus far depended on his children to carry him outside into the garden to feel the sunshine and smell the plants.
Shaikh said that Knight has been a member of the ANC for many years but has been neglected. “We are his adopted grandchildren and has learnt of his needs,” Shaikh said and added that he would focus on the needs of handicapped people this year.
Stuurman said Knight has no physical strength any more yet still commands a lot of respect and provides guidance.
