Police are investigating a case of murder and have registered an inquest docket after the bodies of a mother and her son were found close to the graveyard at Ha-Budeli village outside Thohoyandou on Saturday. According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo the bodies were reportedly discovered by a passer-by who informed the Police.
On their arrival they found the burnt bodies of a 35-year-old woman and her four-year-old son. Police immediately commenced initial investigations and found the remnant of a flammable substance and a box of matches next to the bodies. Upon further investigation a suicide note was also found on the scene, according to Mojapelo.
It is suspected that the woman might have taken her son to the graveyard and doused him with a flammable substance before setting him alight. She allegedly then did the same with herself, according to Mojapelo.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba once again condemned the violent nature in which some people seem to be inclined to when dealing with domestic or relationship challenges.
Mojapelo could not provide the names of the victims at the time of going to print.
Investigations continue.
