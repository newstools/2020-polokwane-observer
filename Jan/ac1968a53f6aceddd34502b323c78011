Well-known local businessperson Jagoobhai Mistry and his wife Manjulaben, would have celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary with family and friends at their home in Nirvana on Wednesday, looking back on seven decades of happiness and health. Further celebrations with their siblings and spouses are scheduled for Friday.
Jagoobhai moved to Pietersburg during 1947 and the couple got married in Durban on 15 January 1950. They are still in good health and do yoga every day, even when they are away from home.
They are blessed with two sons, two daughters and seven grandchildren and are known as respected members of the Hindu community of the city through their involvement in the affairs of the Seva Samaj. Jagoobhai and his team of temple members were instrumental in the building of the Hindu temple in Nirvana and Manjulaben took a leading role as chairlady of the women’s group Mahila Mandal for a few years.
The Mistrys’ recipe for a happy and lasting marriage is mutual trust and respect. “You should maintain the emotion that you felt from the beginning of your marriage. We were poor like everybody around us when we started off and did not expect much in material terms,” Jagoobhai reckoned.
