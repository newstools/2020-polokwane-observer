Premier Stan Mathabatha has wished the outgoing Department of Education Head of the Department (HOD) Beauty Mutheiwana all the best in her future endeavours as she serves her last day in the public service today (Friday).
Mutheiwana submitted her resignation letter to Mathabatha in November. It was learnt that Mutheiwana became the HOD after she was seconded to the department from Provincial Treasury as part of a rescue team deployed to maximise the department’s performance. Provincial government spokesperson Kenny Mathivha indicated that in 2016 the department had almost collapsed and was therefore placed under administration.
The department has since improved significantly including getting out of disclaimers for the first time in 10 years, Mathivha explained. According to Mathivha, the acting HOD from 1 February will be Khathutshelo Onicca Dederen who has been with the department for many years. The advertisement for the position of HOD has been done and a permanent appointment should be made within the next three months, he concluded.
Mathabatha was quoted to have said “On behalf of the Executive Council and the people of Limpopo, I wish Mutheiwana the best as she pursues other career paths. She served with distinction and it is through her efforts that the class of 2019 showed a significant improvement and for that we say thank you.”
