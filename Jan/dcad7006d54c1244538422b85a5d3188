The South African Police Service (Saps) together with the social network Facebook are expected to launch Amber Alert, an initiative focussing on easier and faster tracing of missing children during an event in Sandton, Johannesburg today (Thursday).
According to information on Saps Facebook page an Amber Alert is a missing child emergency alert which works by distributing a message through a system that will enable the Facebook community to actively participate in finding missing children.
Facebookâ€™s Amber Alert initiative is a voluntary partnership with law-enforcement agencies across the globe and Saps is the first in the southern hemisphere to launch this initiative.
National Police Spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo had not responded to queries by the time of going to print.
