Mr Limpopo 2020, Kgeledi Letsoalo in partnership with Scholastica’s Foundation in Tzaneen donated food parcels to indigent community members in Mokgolobotho village near Tzaneen over the Festive Season.
The-21-year old final year Financial Accounting student at Boston City Campus Polokwane said with the gesture he wanted the less privileged to enjoy the season just like anyone else. “I am passionate about community development and throughout my Mr Limpopo reign I will be visiting other less fortunate community members in various communities in the province areas for evaluation and also see how I can help them. I decided to start at Tzaneen because it is my home town and a way of giving back to my community,” Letsoalo said.
He stressed that the Mr Limpopo pageant has opened many doors for him. “It is an honour to be the winner of the inaugural pageant. Special gratitude should go to the organisers of Miss and Mr Limpopo for coming with the male segment because there are no pageants for men. We have a lot of talented models in the province but the platforms to showcase those talents are minimal,” Letsoalo remarked.
