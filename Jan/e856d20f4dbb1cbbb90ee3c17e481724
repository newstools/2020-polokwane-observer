Police in Sekhukhune are appealing to community members to come forward with information that can assist with investigations into an incident along the Jane Furse/Sekhukhune road on Friday during which a truck was allegedly torched and the driver killed.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Kagiso Mphelane (30), accompanied by two crew members, was driving a truck belonging to a building supply company at Tshehlwaneng village when two unknown suspects threw what looked like a petrol bomb at the truck.
Reportedly the front of the truck instantly caught fire resulting in Mphelane burning to death. His crew suffered serious burn wounds and were taken to a nearby hospital.
Police immediately commenced investigations. It is suspected that the incident could be linked to the ongoing strike by employees of the company which resulted in some of them being dismissed, according to Mojapelo.
Anyone with information can contact Col Phalane on 082 414 2663 or the crime stop number 08600 10111.
