Independent primary schools in the Polokwane cluster attended the Ironwood Athletics meeting at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Monday.
The participating schools were Eagle’s Nest Christian School, Bet Shalom Christian School, Curro Heuwelkruin, Mitchell House, Elica Primary School, Jabez Christian Academy, North-View Christian Academy, Akademie Reformia and PEPPS Preparatory School.
Curro Heuwelkruin athletics organiser Robert Marriot who also organised the event, said they were looking for top athletes that will represent the independent primary schools at the upcoming P1 and P2 schools athletics meeting. “We are looking for the top 3 athletes in the field events and top 2 in the tracks. There are many talented athletes from our schools and we will come out with a strong, competitive team,” Marriot said.
At the time of going to press the organising committee was still finalising the team and consolidating the results.
