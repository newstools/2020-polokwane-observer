Residents of Serala View and Flora Park allegedly burned tyres and blockaded streets early this morning (Monday), apparently to voice their dissatisfaction about water shortages as well as the activities of fibre contractor Frogfoot.
Tyres were burned in Serala View and at the corner of Webster and MacDonald streets as well as in the vicinity of the dam in Flora Park. At around 06:30, police and municipal workers were clearing the debris to allow motorists to use the streets again.
Spokesperson for Polokwane Municipality, Thipa Selala said that the matter was being investigated and that he would be able to comment later today.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed that the police had assisted municipal personnel to deal with the matter and that the situation was peaceful and under control. No major damage was caused and no arrests were made.
Attempts to source comment from Frogfoot were unsuccessful.
