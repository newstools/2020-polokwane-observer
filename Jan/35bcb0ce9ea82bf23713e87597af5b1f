Most businesses in the main street and rest of Mookgophong’s business area were closed early yesterday (Wednesday) morning after a group of approximately 300 people protested in front of the local magistrate’s court awaiting the commencement of a murder case.
According to vice-chairperson of the Naboomspruit Veiligheidsforum (NVF), Vossie Vosloo some roads leading to town from the adjacent towship were closed as protesters had set alight tyres since early morning.
“We also received some reports of people being intimidated not to go to work but by 06:30 the roads were opened and the protesters peacefully moved into town towards the court building,” Vosloo said.
At the time of going to print he indicated that he had spoken to the presiding officer in the matter who said that if the suspect’s legal representatives did not pitch within 15 minutes he would postpone the case in their absence.
Vosloo could only indicate that the case was about the murder of a person in the township during October and that protesters were allegedly accusing the Police of dragging their feet in the investigations. He further indicated that the NVF would continue to monitor the situation even when the crowd dispersed after the court proceedings.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the shut-down but indicated that he was still awaiting more information from the cluster commander.
