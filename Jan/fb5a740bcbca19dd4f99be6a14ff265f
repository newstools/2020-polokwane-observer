More than 150 Grade R learners of Noordjieland received their grades during an event at the school at the end of last year as a crowd of delighted parents and guardians looked on. Most of the learners will be part of the 2020 intake at Laerskool Pietersburg-Noord Primary while the rest are expected to be enrolled in other local primary schools.
