Former head coach of Molemole Football Academy, Bayano Moloto was appointed as second assistant coach of Polokwane City Football Club on Monday.
Moloto started playing football at the dusty streets of Seshego and began his coaching career at Simple Yellows Football Club a decade ago.
The-38-year old football mentor also had short stints at both Dolphins Football Club and Ambassadors in Sport Academy. He holds a Confederation of African Football B Coaching Licence.
He was at the helm of the Polokwane City Football Club’s Multichoice Diski Challenge team when they finished third in the 2018/2019 season.
“I am happy with the new venture. It has been my childhood dream to coach at top level. I am looking forward to help the senior team with my football knowledge and expertise,” Moloto remarked.
