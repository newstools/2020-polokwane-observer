Eskom stopped stage 2 load shedding at 06:00 this morning (Friday) and will continue with stage 2 from 09:00 today until 06:00 on Monday.
Eskom said in a media release earlier this morning that this is due to a shortage of generation capacity and depleted emergency resources, which were used extensively to supplement capacity over the past few days. In addition, Eskom is taking out three big units for planned maintenance today.
“Unplanned outages were at 12 722 MW as at 05:30 this morning. We are monitoring the system closely and we will continue to give periodic updates on the status of the power system as things may change at short notice.
We apologise to South Africans for the negative impact this may have on them. We want to assure the nation that critical maintenance is being done to units on planned outages as well as some of those on unplanned outages to ensure their timeous return to service. We will use the weekend to replenish dam levels for pumped storage schemes and diesel for open cycle gas turbines,” the statement concluded.
