The two-year-old toddler who was reported missing last Monday was found about 10 km from her parental home last Wednesday following an intense search operation by Police in the Lebowakgomo area who found her lying on a rock in the bush.
According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo the Police Search and Rescue Unit was joined by members of Le­bowakgomo Police, the K9 Unit and Mounted Unit as well as members of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in search of the girl who went missing at Marulaneng village, Ga-Chuene last Monday.
Mojapelo indicated that residents of the area also searched non-stop for the toddler until she was found unharmed but seemingly dehydrated.
She was taken to the local clinic for observation, according to Mojapelo.
The child’s disappearance was reported to the Police by her grandmother after she allegedly left her at home with her husband.
She then later received a call urging her to return home after the child could not be found.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba applauded the Police and community members for their joint efforts and urged parents and guardians to ensure that they keep track of their children’s whereabouts at all times.
