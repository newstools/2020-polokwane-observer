The Ethical Foundation for Leadership Excellence hosted educators, managers and the school governing body (SGB) of Frans Mohlala Secondary School for a team building workshop at a venue outside the Polokwane area on Friday aimed at strengthening values and ethics in schools.
Chairperson of the foundation, Mautji Pataki during the sessions said they found the officials of the school to be appreciative of their weaknesses and the potential to do better in future. “They are all positive that the school is well positioned to bring positive change in the lives of learners and the community around the school through ethics, leadership and excellence which are key to any success.”
He further stated that they appeal to all schools to appreciate this kind of initiative so that management, educators, learners and governing bodies could work as teams rather than antagonists. “We also want to build cohesive relations between the educators and the SGBs. We have the responsibility to build a sound society using the schools as our springboards. Once the correct attitude to learn and teach is instilled in schools we are guaranteed of a successful society,” concluded Pataki.
Noria Letsoalo, principal of Frans Mohala Secondary School was quoted to have said the workshop came at the time when the school had just recorded a markedly improved matric pass of 64% in 2019 as opposed to 31% in 2018.
She reportedly said building a strong team of support around educators will surely go a long way to sustain the upward trend in all grades.
