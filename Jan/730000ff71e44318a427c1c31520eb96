Pietersburg English Medium Primary School (Pemps) hosted promising young athletes from primary schools in the Polokwane Cluster during the annual P1 Athletics Schools meeting at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium last Thursday. The participating schools were Pietersburg Laerskool, Good Hope, Flora Park, Nirvana, Pietersburg Comprehensive School and Laerskool Pietersburg-Oos.
Mabine Mametja, Head of Sport at Pemps and organiser of the event, said the event not only served as good practice for the athletes but also afforded the organising committee an oppotunity to select a team that will represent P1 schools at the Pietersburg Circuit athletics meeting scheduled for Tuesday at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.
According to Mametja the top two athletes in each event will make the team. “We are happy with the talent displayed by the learners on the day. It is promising and we will come up with a good team. The meeting was also aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle among the learners and nurture their athletics talent.”
At the time of going to press the organising committee was still finalising the team.
