Former Capricorn High School (Cappies) learners Fanessa Makhongela and Thabiso Molokomme collected more than 600 textbooks and other study material that were donated to less privileged learners at ME Makgato Secondary School in Seshego on Monday.
They hosted book drives at the City Library recently where they managed to collect over 400 books. The two started a campaign called ‘Give a Child a Book’ after their matric year in 2018. They said they wanted to give their study material to less fortunate learners but realised that it won’t be enough hence the initiative came about.
Makhogela, a second year Political Science student at the University of Pretoria and Molokome, a second year Operations Management student at the University of Johannesburg reckoned that a shortage of textbooks and study guides are some of the obstacles blocking learners from achieving good marks. They collect books for both primary and secondary curriculums and any other educational books and novels for interest sake.
“During our first edition last year, we managed to collect over 200 books and we are delighted that more people are now coming on board. Individuals in Polokwane believe in our vision and this will assist a lot of learners. We have to join forces to help the less fortunate learners especially those in rural schools who have limited resources,” they explained.
They urged learners to never give up on their dreams and goals but rather continue working hard and always be passionate about what they pursue.
Makhongela and Molokomme concluded by thanking God, their parents, team members and residents for believing in their vision and supporting them.
