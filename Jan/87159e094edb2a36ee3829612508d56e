Open water swimmers can look forward to the annual Ebenezer Mile to be hosted at the Ebenezer Dam just outside Haenertsburg on 21 March, despite low water levels.
Online entries are already open for Limpopo’s only open water swim sanctioned by Swimming South Africa and organised by the Rotary Club of Haenertsburg.
This year’s event marks the 20th anniversary of the Ebenezer Mile and promises to be yet another fun-filled event for amateur and professional swimmers.
Serious swimmers can once again enter for the traditional mile (1 600 m) or the 3 000 m while a fun swim of 500 m will also be hosted for those looking to enjoy the water.
A variety of food stalls and beer garden are guaranteed to add to the joyous atmosphere.
The swim will be hosted on 21 March at the Old Smokey Club House and the first race is about the start at 11:00.
