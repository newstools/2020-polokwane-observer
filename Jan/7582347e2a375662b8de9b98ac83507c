Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors yesterday (Thursday) afternoon disrupted Polokwane Municipality’s council meeting with repeated calls of points of order and a total disregard for requests by Speaker of Council Mariri Ralefatane to obey the rules of order applicable to council meetings.
Ralefatane adjourned the meeting for five minutes to allow the tempers to settle. It was however only resumed nearly an hour later due to many councillors having left the council chamber, apparently to buy lunch.
