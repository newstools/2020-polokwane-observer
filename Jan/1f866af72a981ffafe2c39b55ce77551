Venda based GladAfrica Championship side, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila Football Club has acquired the services of former South African u.23 football squad midfielder, Masibusane Zongo on Monday.
The 29-year-old who also played for Platinum Stars, Supersport United, Royal Eagles and Extension Gunners Football Club in Botswana is expected to help Tshakhuma in their quest to attain the elusive Premier Soccer League (PSL) status.
The club is currently on 7th position of the GladAfrica Championship log with 22 points after 15 matches and they need more victories in order to achieve their goal.
Club’s Chief Executive Officer, Sello Chokoe said they chose to sign Zongo because of his experience in football. “He is one of the most creative players the country has ever produced and has local and international experience. He has played for big clubs in the country and we needed someone of his calibre in the team,” concluded Chokoe.
