PEPPS Preparatory School and College named its 2020 head prefects and deputies during assembly last Monday. Two female learners Mikayla Deverneuil and Kabelo Malahlela were announced as the head prefects and will be supported by Tshepo Molotja and Chika Mabitsela as deputy head prefects.
PEPPS communication and marketing officer Millisa Naidoo indicated that the ambience at the event was special and emotional. She stated that parents of the pupils were informed on a Friday prior to the ceremony of their children’s achievements. However, the pupils themselves were not aware until they were informed on the day, Naidoo added. She further said the proud parents were snuck into the assembly to witness the event.
“On Monday our new prefects attended a breakfast with their parents to celebrate their achievement. We are proud of the hard work and determination that our pupils put into their academic journey at PEPPS,” Naidoo explained and wished the new prefects best of luck in their respective responsibilities.
PEPPS Executive Head Annabel Roberts explained that the school chooses head prefects based on merit rather than gender. A group of other student leaders were announced during the school’s prize giving ceremony in November. They are Thato Thlapane, Lebone Mokgotho, Bonolo Maponya, Puleng Phihela, Khayisa Brancon, Marothi Motshekga, Amantle Bodiba, Moeketsi Dipela, Lesedi Malada, Marvel Tunha, Mahlatse Mamabolo, Musa Sithole, Ndzuvo Makondo and Tseke Sekoati.
