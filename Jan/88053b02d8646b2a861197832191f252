A case of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) follows the baffling discovery of two teenage boys reportedly found in a drugged state on a Welgelegen street on Friday evening, which seemingly left relatives and passers-by gathered on the scene reeling with shock and disbelief.
By the time the 14-year-old and 13-year-old had been rushed to hospital, inquisitive bystanders had joined law enforcers and family members attracted by the activity on the corners of Genl De La Rey and Genl Maritz streets in the otherwise quiet neighbourhood.
On the scene it was learnt that the learners, from a high school several blocks away, were discovered at approximately 18:00 by a woman alerted by the fact that the two were stumbling over their feet and seemed disoriented. A relative of the youngest of the two victims indicated that by then her sister had been searching for her son when she couldn’t initially trace him at school since around 13:30 that afternoon.
The source said upon their discovery the one boy had to be resuscitated by emergency medical personnel while the other was apparently vomiting blood when given water to drink on the scene.
In a statement Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo referred to the criminal case having been registered after the two children were allegedly stabbed and injected with an unknown substance by an unknown suspect at about 18:30 that day.
He stated that upon arrival at the scene Police found two victims – whom he identified but whose identities are being withheld due to their minor status – being treated by emergency medical personnel. According to him the victims were taken to hospital and admitted.
The circumstances that led to the incident are not known at this stage and anyone with information is requested to contact the nearest Police station or the Crime Stop number 0860 010 111.
