Two suspects were expected to appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate’s Court earlier this week following their arrested during an intelligence-driven operation by Police in Tshikota outside Louis Trichardt last Thursday.
Provincial Police Communications Head Mo­tlafela Mojapelo stated that the suspects, aged 27 and 43, are facing charges of house robbery and attempted murder.
He added that Police had recovered a number of firearms, live ammunition, cell phones, a plasma television, a camera, a bicycle, a microwave, grinders, welding machines, a music system, a gas cylinder and gas stove, among others.
The 27-year-old suspect is positively linked to house robbery and attempted murder cases that took place on 7 January at a farm in Waterpoort during which three armed suspects allegedly attacked farm workers who were sleeping in their compound. They reportedly shot and injured one of the employees, according to Mojapelo.
Police swiftly reacted to the call but the suspects managed to evade arrest, leaving behind a Toyota Land Cruiser they had seemingly stolen from the same farm. The vehicle was loaded with allegedly stolen goods such as 20 solar panel batteries, a fan, a grinder, a welding machine, a flat screen television set and blankets. Two of the suspects, aged 25 and 40 years, were arrested the same day with the assistance of the rural safety stakeholders.
They are also linked to a burglary in the same area in December during which 11 firearms were stolen, according to Mojapelo.
