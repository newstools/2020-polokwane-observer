Last Thursday evening’s meeting of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 was a special occasion for club President , Horst Meyer when he inducted his younger brother Reinhardt as a member of the service organisation.
Before pinning the Rotary emblem onto Reinhardt’s shirt, Horst alluded to Rotary’s Four Way Test, being ‘Of the things you think, say or do; Is it the truth, Is it fair to all, Will it build goodwill and better friendships and lastly, Will it be beneficial to all concerned’. He expressed the desire that the Rotarians would embrace the new member and make good use of his capacity to live up to the Rotary motto of ‘Service above self’.
Founder member of the club Klaus Rabiega said that he has known the Meyer brothers since they were toddlers and that he had no doubt that Reinhardt would be a worthy member of Rotary and specifically the club that has been in existence since 1986.
