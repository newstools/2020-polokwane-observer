Residents of Polokwane and surrounds led by the congregation of Covenant House Church in Lesedi Park exchanged paces and flexed their muscles during the church’s Health and Wellness campaign aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle on Saturday.
Members tested their fitness levels during an intense aerobics session, 3,5 km fun run and walk in the streets of Lesedi Park outside Polokwane.
Pastor of the Church Don Makumbana said with the initiative they wanted to promote healthy lifestyle among the residents and the congregation. “We are advocating for healthy lifestyle. We want everyone to live healthy and take care of their bodies because our bodies are the temple of God.”
The church also invited officials from the Department of Health who advised residents to test regularly in order for them to know their HIV/Aids status.
