At the break of dawn on Saturday 18 January 2020, more than a thousand competitors eagerly tied their shoe laces, energised to line up for the annual Seeff /Jaguar Land Rover 3-in-1 race.
For the professional runners, this challenge may have served in preparation of the bigger marathons of 2020, whereby social athletics merely enjoyed the streaks of summer while burning the calories after a long festive season.
Pieter Pretorius (PAC Chairperson) conveyed his appreciation for a race well organised. Emanuel Ramholale was crowned as the winner of the 21 km, with a remarkable 1:13.00, while Pearl Hughes was the first woman to cross the finishing line with an impeccable time of 1:48.10. Pearl was also bestowed with the 40+ category for women.
Jacob Khomola well deserved first place during the 10 km run, with a time of 33.32. In the Junior and Female Category, Precious Munyai stepped away with a 1st place gold medal, with her time of 42:58.
During the closing ceremony, Pretorius thanked all the sponsors for executing and making the event possible, urging athletes to also partake in the Comrades Marathon qualifier run hosted by PAC on 15 February 2020. More details about the event will be communicated in due course.
