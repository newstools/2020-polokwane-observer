Rameez Patel who stands accused of the alleged murder of his wife Fatima in April 2015 and his mother, Mahejeen in September 2017 in Nirvana is expected back in the Limpopo High Court on 30 March when Judge President Ephraim Makgoba will apparently give judgement in Patel’s application for leave to appeal in connection with the case of Fatima.
Patel briefly appeared in court on Monday when, in the absence of Judge Joseph Raulinga, Makgoba acted as presiding officer and is expected to continue to do so.
Fatima was allegedly killed at the couple’s home in Nirvana on 10 April 2015. It is reported that she was assaulted and shot in the face.
While Patel was out on bail in connection with the case he was arrested again in September 2017 days after his mother was allegedly shot by an intruder in the same neighbourhood. She later died in hospital.
He is expected to appear in court again in connection with his mother’s case on 24 March.
