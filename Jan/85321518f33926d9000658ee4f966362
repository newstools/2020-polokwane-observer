Miss Limpopo 2020 Rethabile Mojapelo is eager to touch and change the lives of the less fortunate community members in Limpopo.
The-20-year old mechanical engineering student from Ga-Selala village in Sekhukhune wants to establish small enterprises in all districts of province and employ local people.
She says she wants to start a bakery and employ disabled members of the community in order to fight the scourge of poverty and unemployment. “I also want to create gardening projects where community members will create backyard gardens and sell their produce to community members. I have already started such a project in Zebediela, at the Khomotsong Home where I work with intellectually disabled children who are neglected by their community and marginalised because of their state of being. I want to increase their vocational activities and to help them become entrepreneurs. The owner of Khomotsong Home of the disabled and I decided that we want to extend the vocational activities, and the biggest one we are focusing on is building a bakery. I wish to also extend my services to other disability centres of the five districts of the province to promote entrepreneurship and eradicate self-pity.”
The lanky beauty says among the highlights of her reign were meeting different members of the Provincial Executive Council and visiting community projects and charity organisations in the province.
