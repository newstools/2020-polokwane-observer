Police have launched a manhunt for the suspect(s) involved in the suspected murder of a person whose body was found in a torched vehicle along the N1 outside Modimolle last week.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the remains of a person, burnt beyond recognition, was found inside a burnt-out BMW in the bush along the N1 between Modimolle and Bela-Bela.
Police were allegedly contacted by fire and rescue services after they were alerted by a passer-by about a motor vehicle that was one fire. Police arrived to find that the fire had already been extinguished.
A shotgun was also found close to the scene.
Mojapelo indicated that Police then commenced with investigations and discovered the body of a person in the driverâ€™s seat. Further rummaging delivered a shotgun in the grass a few metres away from the scene. It is believed that the deceased might have been shot before the assailant(s) set the vehicle on fire, according to Mojapelo.
The circumstances that led to the incident are still being investigated and the process of determining the identity of the deceased through DNA testing unfolding. The recovered firearm will be sent for ballistic examination.
Police are appealing to anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspect(s) to contact investigating officer Hendrick Nienaber on 082 565 8606 or report to the nearest Police station.
