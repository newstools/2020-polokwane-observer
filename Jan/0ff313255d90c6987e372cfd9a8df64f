Water consumers in the city may soon face drastic water restrictions and the further drilling of boreholes may be restricted following the municipality’s allocation from Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) being reduced by 15% recently.
This was announced by Polokwane Executive Mayor Thembi Nkadimeng during an African National Congress (ANC) Ike Maphoto Branch meeting with residents of Ward 21 in the city yesterday (Wednesday) evening. Nkadimeng explained that the Department of Water and Sanitation had to limit the water quotas of municipalities as a result of the country wide water crisis. “The boreholes that are utilised by the municipality to augment the supply from LNW are not a reliable source of sustainable water on the long term and the use of water from residents’ own boreholes is escalating to such extent that the groundwater resources are placed under pressure,” Nkadimeng said.
Spokesperson for the municipality, Thipa Selala earlier this morning (Thursday) confirmed that a statement regarding the water restrictions are under preparation and will be released in due course.
