It is business as usual at the offices of Polokwane Municipality today (Thursday) after operations were disrupted by protestors since Tuesday.
Municipal spokesperson Thipa Selala said in a media release yesterday (Wednesday) afternoon that the municipality’s offices will be accessible to the public after a court order has been obtained by the municipality to restrain protesters from intimidating municipal employees and the community by disrupting municipal operations and services.
“The court order gives permission to members of the South African Police Service and Polokwane Municipal Law Enforcement to arrest any individual who, despite knowledge of the order, persists in any unlawful conduct,” Selala said and concluded by saying that the municipality apologises to all its stakeholders for the inconvenience caused by the disruptions and appreciates the patience and cooperation shown by all the customers.
