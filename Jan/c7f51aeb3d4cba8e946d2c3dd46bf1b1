While Baiden Scheepers had to spend the Festive Season behind bars, his brother Aiden was released in December on bail and his case postponed to 28 February.
According to National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Limpopo Spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, Baiden who faces charges of, among others, theft of motor vehicle, theft out of motor vehicle, possession of housebreaking equipment and drugs as well as attempt to escape custody will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court again on 19 March.
Aiden is facing charges of alleged assault of his girlfriend in Westenburg in March last year and theft allegedly committed at an overnight accommodation establishment in Ladanna in August.
Malabi-Dzhangi indicated that the investigating officer did not oppose Aiden’s bail application last year and he was released on bail. She could not provide the bail amount at the time of going to print.
Baiden appeared in court again on 8 January for further investigations and a social worker’s report to be submitted to court.
Baiden appeared in court in December on three separate cases. He was also joined in the dock by co-accused Lourellee Huang (sic) who both face charges of possession of suspected stolen property and housebreaking equipment. Both were released on R500 bail each on 6 September only to see Scheepers back in court about three weeks after being rearrested for being in possession of suspected housebreaking equipment on 21 September.
Baiden was arrested in a dramatic turn of events after he allegedly tried to escape during his appearance in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court in November.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo then confirmed the incident and indicated that a case of attempted escape from lawful custody is now also being investigated against him.
It was also learnt that Baiden has since the attempted escape been moved from the Police holding cells to Polokwane Correctional Centre.
