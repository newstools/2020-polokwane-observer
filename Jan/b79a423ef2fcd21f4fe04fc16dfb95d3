Shariffa Hendricks retired at the end of December after 25 years of service at Capricorn District Municipality (CDM) and its predecessors.
Hendricks joined Northern Transvaal Regional Services Council in May 1995 as levies clerk. She remained with the institution through all the transformation processes following the restructuring of local government and was subsequently appointed to the positions of cashier and salaries clerk until her hard work and dedication resulted in her appointment as Salaries Administrator. “My tenure at CDM was a beautiful journey with life’s normal ups and downs, sometimes gloomy days and sometimes brighter days,” she reckons.
Hendricks looks forward to spending her retirement with her children and grandchildren and visiting her daughter in KwaZulu-Natal.
