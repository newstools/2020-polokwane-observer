The Democratic Alliance (DA) representation in Polokwane Municipality intends to request Speaker Mariri Ralefatane to summon Executive Mayor, Thembi Nkadimeng to appear before the Ethics Committee for abusing her powers and state resources by addressing a community meeting convened by African National Congress (ANC) Ike Maphoto Branch in Ward 21 last Wednesday.
According to DA caucus leader Frank Haas, issues such as water shortages, incorrect billing, broken street lights, rates and taxes and other issues relating to service delivery were discussed during the meeting and important announcements were reportedly made about drastic water restrictions and possible restrictions in relation to the drilling of boreholes.
“It is abundantly clear that this was an abuse of power by the ANC and that they have yet again blurred state and party lines. To hold an ANC meeting under the banner of a municipal meeting is appalling and speaks volumes about the unwillingness of the municipality and the Executive Mayor to listen to the issues that residents who belong to different political parties face,” Haas said.
Haas, who is the elected ward councillor for Ward 21, confirmed that he was not invited to attend the meeting.
MEC for Education, Polly Boshielo was also given a platform to give a report regarding the progress made on infrastructure development within the city.
