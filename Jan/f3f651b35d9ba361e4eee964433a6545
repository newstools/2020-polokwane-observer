The trial of two adults and nine juveniles who are suspected of being involved in the killing of Thorisho Themane (28) in Flora Park in February last year was expected to start in the Limpopo High Court on Monday but the matter was, for an unknown reason, postponed to 29 June.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo as well as National Prosecuting Authoriy (NPA) Limpopo Spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi confirmed that the media would not be allowed to cover the trial as the juveniles and adults would appear in court simultaneously.
The case has been referred to the High Court for trial during the suspects’ appearance in the Polo­kwane Magistrate’s Court in August last year.
Chuene Maleka (35) and Alfred Mothapo (36) as well as nine minors aged between 13 and 17 are suspected of being responsible for the death of Themane who died in hospital on 23 February last year after he was allegedly attacked by a group of people in Flora Park. The incident was also filmed and trended on social media.
