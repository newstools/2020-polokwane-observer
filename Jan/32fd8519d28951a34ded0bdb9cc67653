Several learning institutions across the province started the 2020 academic year with new kids on the block.
Northview Christian Academy welcomed three new educators Hanlie Burger (Grade 3), Tasha Mostert (Grade 1) and Alida Vogel, who teaches Sepedi for Grades R to 3, and financial officer Natasha Veldman. The new arrivals indicated that they were looking forward to a year full of great results and fun as they thanked the school for the opportunity.
This year’s intake of Grade Rs at Stepping Stones ELC and Werk en Wen Pre-primêre Skool have settled in well and the initial anxiety some may have experienced has made way for excitement and anticipation about what the new year holds.
