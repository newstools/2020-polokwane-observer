Consumers in the city may face water shortages or low pressure later today (Wednesday) after Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) has announced earlier this morning that pumping from the Olifantspoort water treatment plant has been stopped due to a leak on the Specon line.
LNW spokesperson Simon Mpamonyane confirmed that it may take up to six hours to repair the leak.
It will also take some time thereafter for the reservoir levels to rehabilitate.
