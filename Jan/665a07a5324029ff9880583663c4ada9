The Vibrant Organisation, a non-profit organisation based in Mankweng, hosted an anti-nyaope campaign in the Segopye area in December.
The campaign saw young people from the area coming together to raise awareness about various social ills and joining hands fight the scourge of the nyaope drug which is prevalent in the area.
Organiser of the event, Sipho Maluleke said during the campaign they also launched an indigenous games league in order to promote social cohesion and keep young people in the area active.
“The league will see community members participating in popular indigenous codes such as diketo, morabaraba, kgati, ncuva and drie stokkies. It will run from January to December. We want to see more young people active sport and doing something productive. By so doing we are protecting them from this dangerous drug,” Maluleke said.
The organization was established in 2016 and it is registered with the Department of Social Development. “Our focus is on community development. We help the addicts to get rehabilitation. We also donated books, stationery and sanitary towels to less privileged community members,” remarked Maluleke.
