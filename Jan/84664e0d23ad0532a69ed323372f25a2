Last Wednesday was a special day for 12 young learners of Jabez Christian Academy when they started their formal school careers and were welcomed by Principal Elana Erasmus.
“Some of the learners were new, while others have been members of the Jabez family since Grade R and RR and were therefore just too happy to see their teachers and friends after the school holidays,” Erasmus reckoned.
