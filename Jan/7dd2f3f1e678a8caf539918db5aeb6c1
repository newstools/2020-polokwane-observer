The issues raised included the alleged irregular appointment of 141 general workers, failure to appointment eight other general workers in compliance with a Labour Court order and inadequate water supply to townships and suburbs. Sanco also voiced its dissatisfaction at the municipality’s practice to award tenders to service providers from outside the province, to the detriment of local entrepreneurs.
Nkadimeng accepted the memorandum and said that it would receive the necessary attention.
