Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Provincial Leader Jossey Buthane addressed party members outside Seshego Magistrate’s Court late this afternoon (Monday) after he was granted bail of R1 000 following his arrest in connection with alleged crime fighting action in the area yesterday (Sunday).
Party members reportedly embarked on action searching for suspects allegedly involved in the recent murder of teen Thoriso Kgomo.
Addressing party members he indicated they were trying to fight crime which is out of hand in Seshego because Police are reportedly lenient while the community is scared of criminals.
“We cannot sit and watch brothers and sisters being robbed and raped so we needed to take action because the Police are allegedly failing to do their job. We cannot live in fear,” he said.
