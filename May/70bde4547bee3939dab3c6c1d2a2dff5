The man, who was admitted to a private hospital facility in Polokwane, needed a life-saving medical procedure and passed away during the operation.

This brings the total number of Covid-19 deaths in the province to three, with 41 positive cases having been recorded since the start of the pandemic.
Health Spokesperson Neil Shikwambana said only 10 active cases remained with those patients being in isolation, while 28 patients have recovered from the virus.
There are currently no Covid-19 patients admitted in public or private health facilities in Limpopo, he confirmed, saying active surveillance programmes were on-going through the departmentâ€™s household screening programme.
