All learner and driver licences, temporary driver licences, motor vehicle licence discs, temporary permits, roadworthy certificates and professional driving permits that expired during the period that commenced on 26 March 2020 and ended on 31 May 2020 will be deemed to be valid and their validity period is further extended with 90 days from 1 June 2020. Motor trade number licences that expire during the same period will be deemed to be valid and are extended for a further grace period of six months from 20 May 2020.
The regulations that were published in the Government Gazette on 20 May stipulate that facilities to be opened should comply with strict measures to safeguard the health of workers as well as the public.
The measures include cleaning and disinfection of the premises, maintenance of social distancing and the provision of facilities to wash hands and to sanitise upon entering the premises.
