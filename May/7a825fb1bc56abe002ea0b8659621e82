With the province’s rain season drawing to an end and no prospects of sufficient rain that will positively impact on dam levels, Ebenezer Dam’s current level of 17,8% is a matter of great concern compared to a level of 68,2% towards the end of May last year.
Ebenezer and Dap Naudé dams are the city’s major sources of water along with the Olifantspoort Water Treatment Plant and although Dap Naudé Dam’s level currently stands at 99,1%, it does not have the capacity to sustain the city’s requirements.
The level of the Doorndraai Dam that provides water to Mokopane and surrounding areas, is at a low of 12,2%, while the level of the Tzaneen Dam is at 20,4%. The Flag Boshielo, Hans Merensky and Magoebaskloof dams are at approximately 101% of capacity.
The Department of Water and Sanitation has appealed to consumers to use water sparingly and although the city has not experienced regular water shortages since the lockdown was imposed, water remains a scarce commodity and the restrictions that were imposed earlier this year, remain in force.
