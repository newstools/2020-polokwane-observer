Baroka Football Club recently released former Ubuntu Cape Town Football Club’s leading goal scorer, Ranga Chivaviro.
Chivaviro joined the Ga-Mphahlele based outfit in July 2018 after a sterling season with Ubuntu. The 27-year-old from Kgapane village in the Tzaneen area struggled to cement his position at the club.
Other players released by the club are Kamogelo Mogaswa Mogau Khwinana and Tebogo Sodi.
Head coach, Daylan Kerr said the players were released due to lack of game time. “It is nothing personal. It is horrible to see players going. They are good players, they work hard and we wish them all the best in their football journey.”
