As part of Covid-19 response, a non- profit organisation, Mphahlele Home-Coming has launched a food parcel drive which has to date managed to provide for families that are in dire need.
The organisation, which is led by young people from Ga-Mphahlele and surrounds has distributed food parcels to 594 destitute families in over 25 villages in Limpopo since the pronouncement of the nation-wide lockdown. Polokwane Observer has learnt that Mphahlele Home-Coming which solely depends on individual donations has since raised over R40 000 which was used to purchase items such as bags of mielie meal, bottles of cooking oil, bags of sugar and bar soaps while local farmers donated over 500 bags of vegetables. The food parcels were distributed to families with a zero income, child-headed homes, families whose incomes were threatened by the national lockdown and with an exception made for some families who are social grant beneficiaries. A total of 20 child- headed homes were assisted in and around villages in Ga-Mphahlele, it was reported.
The founder of the organisation, Moeletji Mapheto has appreciated the support the organisation has received since the launch of the food parcel drive and pleaded with South Africans to continue supporting the initiative to help those in need. “While it is advisable for residents to stay home, our aim is to ensure the needs of the poor are met. We plead with companies and individuals to lend a helping hand with donations from as little as R20.”
She added that they started the food drive after realising that many families were struggling to make ends meet. The organisation prefers donations in the form of shopping vouchers and food parcels as she encouraged individuals and businesses to join forces in helping the less fortunate. Those interested to assist the organisation can contact Mapheto at 079 435 4741.
