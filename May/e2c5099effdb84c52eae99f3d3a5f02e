In anticipation of the expected lifting of some Covid-19 restrictions before the end of this month, the management of Jabez Christian Academy embarked on an extensive sanitising project of the school premises that was completed on Monday.
Principal Elana Erasmus said that the school is ready to welcome learners back after the nation-wide lockdown. “We disinfected all the offices, classrooms and the school hall, passages and bathrooms.
All the surfaces were scrubbed and disinfected. We have also purchased cloth and paper face masks for every teacher and learner,” Erasmus said.
“All learners will be scanned upon entry to the premises and the temperatures recorded on the class lists. Those above 37 degrees Celsius will be sent home to allow parents to take appropriate action. Every learner has a separate double desk and social distancing of more than 1,5 metres is maintained. We have enough accommodation for all our learners and have prepared the school hall for the Gr 8’s,” Erasmus said and added that playground times will also be scheduled.
“We divided the playground into spaces and only four learners will be allowed in a particular space,” she explained.
Erasmus said that she is confident that the learners will be able to bridge the backlog that resulted from the lockdown. “We have mitigated the impact by making use of our WhatsApp learning initiative and are just waiting for the Department of Education to give the green light for us to return to school. The learners are very excited to see their teachers and fellow learners,” she said.
