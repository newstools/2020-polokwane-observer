Polokwane Municipality continues, through its social partners and stakeholders, to make a meaningful contribution to the lives of the needy in the fight against Covid-19.
Last Wednesday, the municipality in partnership with the Limpopo Chinese Community Police Cooperation Centre delivered food parcels to 172 litter pickers at the Weltevreden landfill site on the Silicon Road outside the city, 29 parcels at the Mankweng site and 17 at Moletjie Ga-Makgakga.
The rest of the 350 beneficiaries included domestic workers who lost their jobs during the lockdown and a disabled man.
The food parcels contained 12,5 kg maize meal, 5 kg cake flour, 5 kg rice, 750 ml cooking oil, canned fish and baked beans, salt, brown sugar, coffee creamer, soya mince and other essential items.
Briefing the media about the donation, Polokwane Mayor, Thembi Nkadimeng said the people making a living from the landfill sites are often not considered when beneficiaries are identified. “We have three landfill sites within the Polokwane Municipality and the people collecting waste from those sites are currently not working because of the lockdown,” Nkadimeng said.
“On top of that number of litter pickers, the municipality added a list of domestic workers. The municipality’s Special Focus Office is responsible for, among others, women, children and special cases. The office identified 32 domestic workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic.
“The first lady of the province, through her domestic worker group, submitted 15 of those beneficiaries to bring the number of domestic workers assisted to 47,” Nkadimeng.
Two families whose houses burnt over the past days and a disabled man also benefited from the programme.
“Actually, the man should receive a disability grant from Sassa but that is not the case. He is still not registered for the grant and for that reason, the municipality reckoned it was important to assist him,” Nkadimeng concluded.
