Police cautioned community members in the Alldays area and adjacent farms to be extra careful after seven lions reportedly escaped from their cage at Ingogo Safaris last night (Monday).
Provincial Police Communications Head, Motlafela Mojapelo informed that two males and five lionesses were allegedly spotted by community members roaming the area opposite Speaker Park Phase 1 and 2 in the Alldays policing area early this (Tuesday) morning.
The farm owner and the police have already summoned officials of Limpopo Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (Ledet) who are currently making their way to the area, according to Mojapelo.
At this stage it is not yet clear how the lions managed to escape.
