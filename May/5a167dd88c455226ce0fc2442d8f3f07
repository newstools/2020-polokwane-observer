Five suspects who face charges of money laundering, possession of unregistered medicine as well as contravention of the Medicines and Related Substances Act were expected to appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate’s Court this week following their arrest last Tuesday.
According to Provincial Police Communications Head, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo the suspects appeared in the same court last week and were remanded in custody.
Their arrest stems from an intelligence-driven joint operation conducted by detectives as well as members of the police’s First Responder Team and Crime Prevention Unit in Louis Trichardt.
Mojapelo indicated that information about alleged illegal activities led them to a house in the centre of Louis Trichardt where three suspects were apprehended. During the arrest 150 bottles of 500 ml Adco-salterpyn medicine and cash amounting to R76 000 were confiscated.
Police proceeded to a set of nearby flats where two more suspects were arrested and cash amounting to R66 300 seized. Mojapelo added that the suspects are aged between 23 and 44 years old.
Provincial Police Commissioner Lt Genl Nneke Ledwaba has commended the members for swiftly reacting on the information and the subsequent arrest of the suspects.
