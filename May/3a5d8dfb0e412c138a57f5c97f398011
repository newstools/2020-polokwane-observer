Chief Operations Officer of Polokwane City Football Club, Tincy Tema believes the lockdown period has given the club adequate time to prepare for the last remaining six matches of the Premier Soccer League (PSL).
Before the lockdown, the club was struggling with form and failed to produce desired results.
In their last four matches they lost against the in-form Maritzburg United Football Club, Stellenbosch Football Club, Amazulu Football Club and drew against Golden Arrows.
They find themselves in the 14th position of the league and in desperate need of points in order to avoid possible relegation.
Tema said the morale is high in the team despite the lockdown regulations which have prevented them to train as a collective.
“We are ready to fight for our PSL status. We are aware of our performance but we can assure our supporters that we will do well when the league is back in action. Players are training on their own and they are doing well. We can’t afford to slip up, the last remaining matches are important and we must get maximum points from those matches in order for us to stay afloat in the league. We are just waiting for authorities to tell us when we should start training together.”
Amid the widespread salary cuts at the world’s biggest football clubs, Tema stated that they were pleased that the Coronavirus crisis did not force them to institute pay cuts.“
The personnel received their full salaries for April and May and we are happy. We will continue ensuring that all salaries are paid in full until the end of the lockdown,” Tema remarked.
All PSL matches were postponed in March due to the lockdown and there is still no indication when league matches will resume.
