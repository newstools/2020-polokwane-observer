Mankweng, Moletjie and Seshego Polokwane taxi ranks were recently provided with 5 000 litre water storage tanks by the Polokwane Municipality as part of government’s efforts to curb the spread of the Coronavirus.
The water tanks will enable commuters, queue marshalls and taxi operators to wash their hands with soap at critical times to flatten the curve of the pandemic.
Provincial Spokesperson for the National Taxi Alliance, Frans Kgasago said the gesture will ensure that commuters assist to combat the effects and spread of the pandemic. “Our commuters are our lifeblood and we want them to be safe at all times. For us to reduce chances of being infected by the virus we need to wash our hands regularly and the water tanks will be handy.”
Matshidiso Mothapo, Polokwane Municipality Spokesperson said the tankers were installed at the ranks to ensure that commuters follow hygiene measures. “It is our responsibility to ensure that public spaces are safe. The tanks are in line with safety regulations of promoting thorough and regular hand washing by commuters and taxi operators.”
Francinah Letsoalo, a commuter from Moletjie said the water tanks will be handy because people will be able to help government curb the spread of Covid-19. “It is not easy to wash hands for 20 seconds but now we will be able to fulfill that practice while waiting for the taxi.”
Kgobo Kgomo from Lebowakgomo said the tanks will ease the water woes the city is usually confronted with. “Sometimes there is no running water in the taps in the proximity of the taxi ranks. The stored water will assist during such circumstances.”
Wilhelmina Malebati from Mankweng said hawkers selling goods at the taxi ranks will also benefit from the tankers. “They will be able to get water from the tanks to cook, drink, wash their hands, utensils and cutlery.”
