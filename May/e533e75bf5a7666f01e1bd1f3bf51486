Polokwane Municipality has received information that there are fraudsters conning unsuspecting business people by informing them that they have been given contracts for capital projects by the municipality and have to pay a fee upfront to secure their appointments.
The Spokesperson for the municipality, Thipa Selala said that is alleged that the fraudsters request their victims to deposit large sums of money up to R500 000 into their accounts before they can finalise the paperwork related to the contracts.
“The municipality has referred one case with proof of payment to the law enforcement agency dealing with such criminal activities,” Selala said. He added that the municipality’s administrative operations including appointment of contractors for new projects are affected by the lockdown, resulting in the municipality’s strategic business units not being fully operational.
“Members of the public are further alerted not to fall victim to such scams and to report anyone who approaches them with such requests to the police,” Selala requested.
