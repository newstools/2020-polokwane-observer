The Department of Education is advising School Management Teams (SMTs) not to report for duty on Monday. Although the Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga announced last Thursday that SMTs should report for duty on Monday, 11 May to start with preparations for the phasing in of the Gr 7s and Gr 12s, reopening of schools is dependent on a number of strict Covid-19 related conditions and protocols which are yet to be  met by the department.
This is according to departmental Spokesperson, Tidimalo Chuene as she mentioned that conditions and protocols include safety of school buildings, offices and the health of learners, teachers and support staff.
Chuene indicated that the massive demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) around the country has resulted in some delay in delivery of material that has been procured for schools, offices and other learning facilities.  “School readiness materials ordered include sanitisers, masks, visors, detergents and infrared thermometers. Delivery is expected in the next few days. The department is working through the Provincial Command Council and its technical committee to ensure that these conditions are met and this process is still continuing,” Chuene explained.
Management of the department has also established various work streams wherein organised labour and other stakeholders will participate in tracking progress towards school readiness, she emphasised.
Chuene reiterated that it is on this note that the department is postponing the return of SMTs to a date that will be communicated in due course.
A circular has been issued to district directors and circuit managers to communicate to all officials, teachers and support staff to this effect, Chuene concluded.
