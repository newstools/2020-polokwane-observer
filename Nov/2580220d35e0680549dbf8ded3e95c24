Sensei Annatjie de Jager is a small package, who packs a mean punch and kick.
The karateka started participating in the sport in 1985, and through many years of training and perseverance, achieved the coveted fifth dan.
Sensei means ‘teacher – one who came before you’ and teaching is her passion. “I love working with karatekas from a young age and to walk with them on their way to success, as I watch them grow and develop day by day,” she says.
Annatjie believes a sensei must inspire, teach and demonstrate and at all times, be a role model to students.
“I am a qualified self-defence instructor and have also completed first aid courses to assist our students. Karate has no age limit and all genders are welcome. Male and female practice the same techniques, same fighting skills and each person learns at their own pace.”
Annatjie said when a person learns karate, they get active, healthy and it reduces stress. “They learn self-defence, develop their self-confidence and self-esteem, which allows them to go out in life with less fear and a warmer, more open attitude.”
She started Yinyang Karate and Self-defence Studio to equip the youth with a set of skills they can use throughout their lives, and to motivate them to always do their best.
Annatjie finds her inspiration from the masters of her art, as well as from her snake, spiders, bird and bearded dragon. She also enjoys gardening in her free time.
She believes that karate is a way of life, something she teaches her students with the hope that they develop the same passion for the sport.
To her the soul of the sport is not only what it means to her but what it can mean to others.
“Karate is a martial art that relies heavily on skill to overcome brute force, meaning that even the biggest opponent can be brought down to size if you have proper timing, precision and accuracy.”
