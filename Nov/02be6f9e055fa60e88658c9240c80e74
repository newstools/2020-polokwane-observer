Young equestrians affiliated to the Capricorn Western Club were given a platform to showcase their skills at the club’s fun day held at Winnfield Stables in Dalmada on Saturday.
A member of the club, Sharon Venter said they were happy to see riders back in the saddle after an eight month lay-off as a result of the lockdown.
“We had about 40 riders on the day and one could see that they missed competing at the stables. This was our last event for the year and it is our hope that they will come back fit and strong next year.”
