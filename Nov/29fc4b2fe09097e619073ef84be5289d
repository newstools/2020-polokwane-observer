Over the past weekend, 80 patients from Giyani who needed cataract surgery were operated on at Netcare Pholoso Hospital.
Health MEC, Dr Phophi Ramathuba committed to eradicate the surgical backlog in Limpopo and to change the lives of the people in the province.
According to Thabang Moyaba, the hospital’s Client Liaison Officer, Mankweng Hospital is the only provincial hospital in the province to perform these operations.
“The patients were booked and screened at Nkhensani Hospital. They will never be able to afford private healthcare but through our collaboration they are going to benefit.”
Ramathuba thanks Netcare Pholoso for the partnership. “We want to thank Netcare Pholoso for listening to our plight and agreeing to come onboard. It is partnerships like these ones which can take our country and nation forward. This will go a long way in reducing the surgical backlogs.”
The department continues to send ophthalmologists to various rural hospitals to continue to clear the cataract surgical backlogs.
