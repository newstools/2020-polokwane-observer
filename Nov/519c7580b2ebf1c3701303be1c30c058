Gunmen and women from across the country flocked to the local shooting range on Saturday to show off their skill and accuracy during a national pins shooting challenge.
Local competitors also attended with their guns loaded as they battled it out in various categories. They had to shoot five of 10 pins with the least number of shots fired.
Safety protocol was observed at all times. Participants had to wear eye and ear protection and younger competitors were allowed to shoot under supervision of their parents.
The results were not available at the time of going to print.
