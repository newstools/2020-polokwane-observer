Headmaster of Mitchell House, Andrew Cook bid farewell to the Gr 7 learners during their valediction ceremony held at the school on Wednesday evening.
In his short speech Cook described the learners as a group of exciting individuals with different characters and strength.
“We wish them luck on their next journey. Some will be going to various secondary schools while some will remain here with us. We are saying to them, carry the school’s values which are kindness, compassion, respect with you, and always be in pursuit of excellence.”
He also told learners that they must work hard and refrain from self-entitlement.
“Gratitude is the antidote to entitlement. It is about recognising that none of us got there on our own.”
Kerry Spratt, Deputy Head said she is proud to have been their leader throughout the years, and wished them well on their secondary school journey. “They are going to be successful in life. I am going to miss their sense of humour, fun, camaraderie, and the support they have shown to each other in all the years.”
