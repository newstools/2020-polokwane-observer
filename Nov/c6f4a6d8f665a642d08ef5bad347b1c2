Members of the Phuthaditshaba Lutheran Church in Zone 8, Seshego, were overjoyed last Saturday when members of the Rotary Club of Polokwane arrived at the church and planted 12 indigenous trees on the premises.
The trees were part of a consignment of more than 100 trees that were donated to the Rotarians by Capricorn District Municipality (CDM).
Champion of the project, Marius Liebenberg was assisted by Rotarians Seja Rapholo and Putla Makgato and member of the church, Lischen Magapu.
Liebenberg thanked Theo van Rooyen and Arnot Ravele of CDM for their assistance to obtain the trees and to other Rotarians for their support with transport.
