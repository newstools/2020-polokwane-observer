After qualifying for Limpopo colours in swimming, young and ardent swimmer, Cherise Swartz from Action Aquatics Academy believes she is on the right track to achieve her goals.
The 16-year-old learner from Tom Naudé Technical High School achieved the feat at the recent swimming gala held in Bela-Bela. She clocked a time of 35,67 seconds in the 50m girls u/16 freestyle event in order to qualify for provincial colours.
She also qualified for level 3 of the National Swimming Challenge scheduled for March 2021 in Polokwane.
Swartz says she aims to dominate the local swimming events but she must double her efforts in order to fulfill her quest. “There is still a lot to do. I need to work harder to achieve all the goals I have set for myself. The advantage is that I am still young and eager to achieve more. I have just qualified for Limpopo colours and this is my biggest achievement thus far. I started swimming at the age of 12 when I was at Ooskool and I have never achieved such a milestone. I am really looking forward to the two events next year. We have already started with the preparations and all is going well. I cannot wait to face the best young swimmers in the province,” Swartz said.
She pointed out that she would love to further her swimming career in the US in the near future. She described the States as the home of swimming champions. “They have strong swimmers. The US is the home of Michael Phelps who is the most successful Olympian of all time. I would like to be under the tutelage of those coaches in those swimming academies.
“I want to achieve greater things and compete at major swimming championships such as the Olympics and Fina World Aquatics Championship, to name a few. On my return I can share the skills and the expertise with other aspiring swimmers in my country.”
