Members of the Africa Muslim Agency and Polokwane Muslim Society joined forces at Nirvana Shopping Centre last Friday to raise funds for refugees and destitute children of Lebanon who are struggling to cope with icy conditions that have currently engulfed the country.
Members of the two organisations sold braai meat, salads, and scones to community members and all the proceeds will go to the affected children and destitute families in Lebanon.
One of the volunteers, Mohamed Yaseen Essa said they were aiming to raise R3 million that will cater for 70 000 families.
“That is our target and God willing, we will attain it. We will be having more similar initiatives. We are planning to travel to Lebanon before the end of the year to personally hand over the proceeds. We are a caring society and we felt the pain that the children and destitute families are going through in that cold weather. Some do not have proper shelter, clothes and food. It is heartbreaking and we thought it would be befitting to reach out to them.”
