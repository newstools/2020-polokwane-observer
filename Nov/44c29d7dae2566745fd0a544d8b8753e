Wet and muddy gravel roads quickly turned into a cloud of dust as quad and two-wheel bikers opened throttle during this year’s last enduro race hosted by Swannies Racing at Ysterberg on Saturday.
The five-hour enduro tested bikers’ skills and stamina to the extreme and in order to finish with a podium position and to earn a trophy there was little time to waste to complete as many laps as possible within the cut-off time.
Participants could enter as a team and for the brave bikers, the ironman category was the perfect challenge.
At the prize-giving, Conrad and Jason claimed victory in the open team bike category while Stephen and Christiaan top-scored in the open team quad category.
TJ finished first in the ironman quad category while John-Care walked away with gold as the winner of the ironman bike category.
Younger riders also showed off their throttle skills in a two-hour enduro. George took the victory after completing 15 laps while AJ and Troy claimed second and third place both with 14 laps.
The next event is planned for 6 February in the Letsitele area. Off-road biking enthusiasts will be updated as soon as arrangements for the event has been finalised.
