The class of 2020 at Stanford Lake College enjoyed their official last day of school on Friday, 9 October.
The day was a roller coaster of emotions as they enjoyed the last day traditions, albeit a little different compared to previous years.
The ceremony was live-streamed for parents and family members to view from the comfort of their homes, and was watched by over 180 people.
The Gr 12 class gathered at the Barnyard for the valediction and prize-giving ceremony, where they heard stories of Ubuntu and hope from guest speaker, Sonja Kruse, as well as great speeches from headmaster, Alan Redfern, and the headboy and headgirl.
Many learners received trophies for their contributions to the school and the formalities were followed by the ceremonious throwing of coloured paint and, of course, jumping in the lake.
