Karatekas of Henri Eksteen Fight Club showed up in their karate gear, all set to make every punch and kick count at a special camp hosted by Soke Henri Eksteen at his dojo over the weekend.
Eksteen says that the club held the camp for karatekas to get them into shape and build momentum after the lockdown, and to prepare for upcoming competitions to be hosted towards the end of November and mid-December.
“The karate Gashuku camps are held twice a month throughout the year. This one was aimed at preparation for the year-end Covid-19 Karate Championships. It will be a lot more challenging as strict Covid-19 regulations will be in place with no spectators allowed. Once the competitors have taken part and their division is completed they will go home and will not be allowed to hang around,” Eksteen says.
The karatekas took on the challenge full force and showed their dedication in every punch and kick.
One of the dedicated karatekas, Katlego Mongoai (16) attended the camp even though he was involved in a freak accident earlier the day. Katlego said he was standing under the carport, when he noticed that the carport was falling, he rushed to get in-between the vehicle and the carport to try and protect the vehicle from any damages. He was caught between the wooden port and the vehicle and had to be rescued.
He sustained injuries to his head, back and eye but refused to miss the karate camp.
“This shows dedication to the sport and it means a lot to me as a trainer to see how much he loves the sport, not even an accident could keep him away,” Henri said.
