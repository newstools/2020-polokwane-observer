Another enjoyable evening of Paint and Wine was recently hosted at Cappuccino’s Mall of the North.
The latest instalment of this fun evening took place on Thursday, 19 November hosting participants who were excited to make their own paintings to take home.
Known by now as the Polokwane Paint and Wine lady, Sheralyn Janse van Rensburg once again taught guests how to paint their own masterpieces using simple techniques that make for a great final product.
The guests are treated to a glass of wine upon arrival, and are free to order from the menu as they please.
This open event is a great opportunity to socialise while learning a new skill.
Sheralyn says some guests have been at every Paint and Wine event that has been held thus far, simply because it is so much fun. Follow Paint and Wine on their social media pages to find out when they’ll be back in town.
