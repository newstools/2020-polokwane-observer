Mzansi Athletics Club cancelled their inaugural Mzansi 3-in-1 race which was scheduled for 28 November.
According to club chairperson, Richard Bilisi the race was cancelled due to Covid-19 protocols and regulations. “The race will hopefully take place next year as per the Athletics South Africa (ASA) calendar. With regards to the regular official training, the club will await the necessary directives and compliance guidelines from ASA .”
He also added that in the meantime, in compliance with the rules, runners can continue to train in small groups or individually. “Runners cannot wait to get back on the road to run together without limitations and restrictions. They need official races to quench their thirst and showcase their fitness which they worked hard for since lockdown.”
“The Covid-19 pandemic has affected economic activities and business in general which had an impact on sponsorships. But Mzansi is ready to partner with corporates or public entities in future to deliver road running races in the province. We therefore encourage those who are interested in partnering with us to contact our Secretary Max Maligana at Mzansiac@gmail.com or contact us through our Facebook page MzansiAthletics Club.”
“Residents are all welcome and encouraged to join the fast-growing running family in Limpopo regardless of their fitness level, running pace, age or geographic area. The club’s Comrades Marathon training coach has a proven track record in making running fashionable and turning ordinary people into regular athletes and even Comrades medalists,” Bilisi concluded.
