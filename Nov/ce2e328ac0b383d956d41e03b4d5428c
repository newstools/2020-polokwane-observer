The Limpopo Provincial Command Council (PCC) reported last week that the province was still below the threshold of the resurgence, or the supposed second Covid-19 wave, which is 20% positive cases over a seven-day period.
Last week’s virtual bi-weekly meeting was held to primarily process reports regarding the provincial government’s response to the Covid-19 scourge.
Covid-19 statistics, as at 18 November, revealed the total number of infections in the province as being 18 179 cases, 17 387 recoveries with 487 people having succumbed to the virus.
Up to 18 November, the province had recorded 1 364 positive cases with 1349 of these fully recovered, among healthcare workers.
There were only six active cases and nine healthcare workers succumbed to the virus.
With 148 630 learners registered for the National Senior Certificate examinations, only one positive case of Covid-19 was detected since the commencement of examinations: The candidate was allowed to write in isolation, with all Covid-19 pandemic preventative protocols adhered to.
The PCC has also noted that the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has extended the National State of Disaster from 15 November to 15 December, in accordance with the Disaster Management Act.
The PCC stressed that alert level one does not mean that citizens are free from the coronavirus and has urged everyone to be more vigilant so as to avert the resurgence of the virus.
Precautionary measures of social distancing, wearing of masks and sanitising should be second nature to all, according to a press statement issued on behalf of the PPC by the Premier’s Spokesperson, Willy Mosoma.
