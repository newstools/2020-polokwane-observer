Members of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 and the Anns took advantage of a clear summer’s day to host the club’s annual prawn braai at Ebenezer Dam on Saturday.
The first guests arrived as early as 11:00 and there was ample time for relaxation and fellowship while they enjoyed the mussel brew with garlic and lightly toasted bread nips prepared by Rotarian, Bok van Kraayenburg. When the prawns landed on the grid, the taste buds were toned and the guests indulged in the delicacies that were supplemented with steam fried hake portions or chicken for those who preferred it to prawns.
President of the club, Naas Vorster said the event was a great success and that the observance of social distancing did not interfere with the fun. He thanked all the Rotarians and Anns for their participation and assistance.
