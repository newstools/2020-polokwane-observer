Transport and Community Safety MEC, Mavhungu Lurule-Ramakhanya has sent a stern warning to those who do not obey the rules of the road.
Speaking at the launch of Transport Month, Lurule-Ramakhanya said from 1 October more than 89 people were arrested for driving under the influence and 481 people charged for speeding.
Lurule-Ramakhanya said the department will implement integrated law enforcement operations throughout the province.
“We are once again adopting a zero tolerance approach.
“We have seen a sharp increase in fatal accidents on our roads and most are head-on collisions caused by reckless and negligent drivers.
“So, the operations will focus on un-roadworthy vehicles, illegal public transportation, speed enforcement, drunken driving, road safety awareness activities, and all criminal activities.
“No stone will be left unturned, we are urging all road users to comply with the rules of the roads,” Lurule-Ramakhanya remarked.
