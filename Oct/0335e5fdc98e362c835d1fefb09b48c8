All logistics for the city’s annual Oktoberfest that will be hosted by the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 and the local German community on 31 October at 18:00 are in place.
The usual venue at Bolivia Estate that has a capacity of 1 000 persons will be utilised but attendance will be restricted to 250 party goers in order to comply with Covid-19 regulations. Live music by the popular Velvet Sounds Traditional German Ompah Band will ensure an evening of great entertainment and schweinenbraten, sauerkraut, kartoffelsalat and a green salad will complete the menu. A variety of beers as well as a gin bar will be available and a craft beer stall will cater for those with a special taste.
According to Horst Meyer, the Oktoberfest has been arranged due to popular demand and some tickets have already been sold. “Buy your tickets early to ensure that you do not miss out on the fun,” Meyer advises.
“Ticket prices have been reduced to R200 per person for this year to allow everyone to take part in the event and make a contribution towards the funds that are donated to charities,” Meyer adds.
