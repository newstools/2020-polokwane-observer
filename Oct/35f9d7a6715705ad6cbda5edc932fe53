The Premier, Chupu Mathabatha, has called upon law enforcement agencies to do everything in their power to investigate and arrest all the perpetrators in the spate of brutal killings that have been plaguing the city in recent weeks.
In the same spirit, the Premier has called on the courts to hand down harsher sentences to perpetrators.
In Polokwane alone, seven people have been murdered in the past two months.
It is against that background that the Premier told the Salga’s Provincial Members Assembly, held virtually on Tuesday, that he would like to pass on his heartfelt condolences to the families, relatives and friends of all those who have been murdered.
“Provincial Government is deeply saddened and disturbed by the growing number of reports of people being killed.
I am calling on all family members, relatives, friends, churches, NGOs, traditional leaders, community members and all peace-loving people of Limpopo, to take care of each another.”
According to Mathabatha the province has had to endure the hardship of these senseless killings. “It is our collective responsibility to look out and help each other during difficult times as we also do during the good times.
One life lost is one too many,” said Mathabatha.
He further called on those who feel overwhelmed by the problems and challenges of life to seek professional help which is readily available in public and private facilities, instead of resorting to taking the lives of innocent people.
