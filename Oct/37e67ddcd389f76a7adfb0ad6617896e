A local resident of a smallholding just outside Polokwane suffered some damages to his house after a fire completely destroyed the kitchen on Tuesday evening.
Home owner Jan van As was not home when the fire started and his workers called his son, Tim who then got hold of his father to report the fire.
The Polokwane fire brigade was quick on the scene after they received the first distress call at about 19:30.
At the time of the fire brigade’s arrival, workers had already used hoses in an effort to extinguish the flames. It was learnt that the kitchen was completely destroyed while several other rooms had smoke and water damage.
Van As has lived in the house for the past 26 years. It is an old house and he suspects that the fire started in the kitchen.
“I am lucky to have a place to sleep as there is another house on the property to be used in the meantime. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone that responded quickly and assisted to put out the blaze,” Jan says.
