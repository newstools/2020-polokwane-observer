COTH Polokwane has lost a very committed member of the worship team, who would often use her talent to minister the word of God.
Joyce Monareng joined the church over five years ago, and senior Pastor, Vusi Mashabane said it is devastating to deal with the loss, especially considering the way in which she lost her life.
The police in Seshego have launched a manhunt for the suspect who brutally killed Joyce, whose body was found with multiple stab wounds last Wednesday. Preliminary investigations revealed that the vehicle stopped at an intersection and the badly wounded woman emerged from it and collapsed nearby.
An unknown man wearing yellow overalls also jumped out of the vehicle and fled the scene, leaving the vehicle behind. Joyce was certified dead on the scene.
Her son Tshepo, says he spoke to his mother minutes before she was attacked, as they had plans to get together.
“In our last conversation, she told me she had just wrapped up work in Seshego and asked me to meet up with her at her flat. I called her when I got there and she answered but all I could hear were weird noises in the background before the call was disengaged. After that her phone was off. I later received messages from her phone, I tried to stall, buying as much time as possible as I alerted the police. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the scene she had passed away.”
Tshepo describes his mother as a multi-talented businesswoman who was involved in real estate, catering, investment schemes and church was a huge part of her life. “My mother loved the house of the Lord, and would take any opportunity to minister. She used her voice to Worship and had recently entered the Ingoma Gospel Awards. We were all looking forward to the award ceremony where we hoped she would snatch an award.” He says the family appreciates the support they have received.
