After the recent murder of Jade Stander, the community of Westenburg gathered at the location where he was shot to pray for peace and his family during this difficult time.
Jade was shot and killed after he reportedly pulled out a knife during an altercation in Westenburg on Friday, 9 October. He was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The suspect in the matter is in police custody.
The prayer attracted a number of residents who also felt it necessary to pay their last respects, during the prayer various people spoke of how he was always so friendly and helpful saying that the community of Westenburg truly lost a gem.
His aunt Andriesa Stander, says the family appreciates the support they have been given and are pleading with the community to also avail themselves during the court proceedings. “If we can show unity as a community, then justice will be served. Public outcry often plays a role in such cases and every little support will make a difference. It is time to show the rest of Polokwane that Westenburg stands together.”
Another prayer service was held the next day and Jade was laid to rest on Saturday, 17 October.
