Cindy Thlathla is a 19-year-old who puts her pride aside to help her mother collect recyclable material.
Thlathla who completed her Gr 12 last year, explained that she decided one day to accompany her mother. “I did not think that we would actually be picking through people’s trash so I had to adjust my attitude. I had to look at it as helping my mother and saving the planet at the same time,” she explained.
She now goes out with her mother whenever she can and has developed a keen interest in knowing more about the recycling industry. Despite having passed Gr 12, her grades were not as good as she hoped. “In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise because it has given me another opportunity to work towards a bursary as I cannot afford to further my studies without some form of financial assistance,” she said.
She is not letting that discourage her because she has identified multiple opportunities to assist her mother to put food on the table, such as being a consultant for a skin product company, she also does sales on the side, but her biggest love is fitness which she currently does to relieve stress. She plans to continue recycling even if she gets the funding to pursue a law degree through Unisa.
“I hope to use recycling to create employment because I am from a community that has a bleak future on the employment front. Collecting recyclable waste has taught me not to look down on anything and anyone, as well as the importance of hard work,” she said.
