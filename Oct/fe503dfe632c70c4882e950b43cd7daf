With reports of gender-based violence (GBV) being rife, it will take efforts from all corners of society to restore peace and safety. Religion plays an important role in society hence institutions such as churches are a focal part of addressing social ills.
Polokwane Observer spoke to Provincial Chairperson of South African Council of the Churches, Reverend Awedzani Nemaukhwe about the role that religion plays in the stand against gender-based violence. He explained that GBV has been part of life from time immemorial as women were never regarded as decision makers but as objects.
Religion is a human construct and plays a major role in how women are viewed in society.
“If you take the story in John 8:3, it shows how women were violated. We need to re-interpret scriptures, particularly those where women are violated.
“Women must never submit to ungodly practices even if religion says so,” he said.
John 8:3 is a chapter in the Bible where scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery to Jesus Christ, making her stand in the centre to be condemned.
“The problems in society is that churches are often confronted with physical assault and cultural practices that oppress and violate the rights of women.
The Bible in Ephesians 5:21 talks about submitting one to the other as an act of reverence to Christ. Submission is not equal to being a doormat.
“There is no prescribed role for the church except to treat and take care of those who have been violated by the powerful however the church plays the role of advocacy, standing with victims and assisting in making sure that the perpetrator’s behaviour is corrected by taking them through counselling,” he said.
