A cell phone application aimed at enabling residents to lodge a service delivery complaint in a language of their choice, was launched in the presence of the Deputy Minister in the Presidency, Thembi Siweya at Jack Botes Hall on Tuesday.
The launch of the application and USSD code forms part of the re-engineering process of the Presidential Hotline.
Limpopo Premier, Stan Mathabatha and other provincial and local government officials were in attendance.
The app, launched under the name, Khawuleza Mobile App, and code allow an alternative measure to reach the hotline, which used to be only accessible via telephone and e-mail.
“The app and code will enable citizens to lodge a complaint in a language of their choice on their phones.
“They will be able to track their queries through a reference number and can expect their matter to be resolved within seven days.
“Citizens will also be able to lodge their complaint anonymously to make it easy for whistle-blowers to report on any transgression in service delivery,” a statement by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation reads.
The MEC for Social Development, Nkakareng Rakgoale, says the app will make sure people in the province are able to have access to the services they require.
“The app can even take a picture, whether it is of a borehole or bridge which was started and never completed, and will provide more evidence of what you are enquiring about.
“This is an improvement and something our people should take advantage of, in order for government to improve on the services they deliver,” she remarked.
The app is available for download on Android phones and a link will be provided for Apple phones, the department explained.
