Budding swimming star, AJ Jordaan has set high goals for himself.
The 17-year-old Gr 11 learner at Hoërskool Pietersburg aspires to be one of the top swimmers to come out of the City of Stars.
He says he want to follow in the footsteps of retired Olympic gold-medallist and former world record swimmer, Lyndon Ferns. He says Ferns has paved the way for young talented swimmers in Polokwane.
“He is a former learner of PHS who has left a long-lasting legacy. He is part of the elite swimming group that won the rare silverware at the Olympics. “This is something that we don’t hear of everyday. I hope to be part of the swimming group from the school that takes his legacy further.”
AJ represented his school at the South Africa Junior Championship which took place in Durban last year.
He further stated that the experience he gained at the championships will help him to qualify for the South African Swimming National Championship earmarked for Durban next year.
“I want to get into the national team, but for me to achieve that I must work hard. It is everyone’s wish to represent the country in a major tournament and with me it is no different. I want to go to the Fina Swimming Championships, the Olympics and participate in other international swimming events.”
AJ is a member of the Action Aquatics Academy and part of the team set to compete at the local swimming gala pencilled for Bela-Bela on 30 October.
He joined the academy in September and he is swimming under the tutelage of seasoned swimmer Ude Fuchs.
