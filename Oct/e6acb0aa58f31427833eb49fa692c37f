The Eksteen Ryu Bushido Freestyle Karate Do Institute recently hosted a senior black and brown belt grading examination under owner and chief examination officer, Professor Soke Henri Eksteen.
The event was held on 10 October and gave the karatekas the opportunity to show off their skills and be rewarded for their hard work. The candidates were all promoted to their next levels of ranking status within the organisation, with excellent overall marks. Yudansha Edward Makobela was promoted to brown Kyu 2, Sensei Khensani Mashela was promoted to second Dan, he has been with the dojo for 15 years, Sempai Nonhlanhla Banda was promoted to first Dan and he has been with the dojo for 13 years. Sempai Lebogang Mathapo has been with the dojo for 10 years and was promoted to first Dan.
Eksteen says he is humbled and honoured to have such incredible loyal and dedicated practitioners within his dojo. What makes these gradings extra special is the fact that he has seen these young adults grow-up in front of him since the age of six years old.
