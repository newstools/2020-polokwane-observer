The scrumhalf of Noordelikes Rugby Club, Brandon Lehmann has expressed concern over the supposed dwindling standard of rugby in Limpopo.
The 24-year-old Marketing Manager at Pro-Solutions says many semi-professional rugby clubs in the province have faded away in the past years due to the lack of financial backing.
Lehmann says the province might not have adequate rugby clubs in the near future due to lack of sponsorship. “Rugby is on the brink of collapse in Limpopo. We only have a few clubs and that is a worrying factor. We used to have plenty of clubs in the province but some have faded away. We need businesses to come on board and rescue rugby in the province,” Lehmann said.
He added that Limpopo could be on par with Gauteng, which has better resources and plenty of rugby clubs if the business community extents a helping hand. “Rugby clubs in those areas stand head and shoulders above us. Many people do not support the sporting code and that is a worrying factor for us. It is difficult to run the teams without sponsorships as it is the heartbeat of every club. For some reason, they are reluctant to sponsor.
Despite his worries, the newlywed number 9 says he still has aspirations of playing for a top rugby franchise.
“The dream is still there but I got married last year and I want to focus on my marriage. I still have many years in my rugby career, but if the opportunity of playing rugby at a higher level comes I won’t say no, I will make good use of it.”
Lehmann joined Noordelikes in 2015 and he has already won a lot of accolades at the club. He was named Backline Player of the Year at the 2017/18 season club awards and recently won the Man of the Match Award during their league’s warm-up match against Letaba Rugby Club.
