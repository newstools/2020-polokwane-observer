Meropa Casino gets ready to deliver on its birthday promise. On 12 February 2020 Meropa kicked off its 18th birthday with an exciting Birthday Thrills promotion that included a Nissan NP200 and a share of R50 000 in cash. Little could anyone have guessed that a global pandemic would put the brakes on the competition. Instead of attending the scheduled draw on 27 March 2020 entrants in the competition entered day one of a national lockdown.
“Although at the time Covid-19 took some of the thrill out of our 18th birthday, we are delighted to be out of the hard lockdown and will pick up our celebration with a rescheduled draw on Thursday, 22 October,” said Peter Guthrie, Meropa GM.
All Sun International Most Valued Guests (MVGs) who earned 40 casino points at Meropa between 12 February and 24 March, when the property had to be closed, have qualified to be entered into the draw. MVGs are reminded to activate their entry into the draw by redeeming their draw tickets on 22 October between 08:00 and 19:45 at the self-service ticket kiosk. The draw will take place at 20:00.
