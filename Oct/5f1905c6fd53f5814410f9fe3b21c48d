“Justice for Jade!”
During the bail application of the accused in the murder of Jade Stander, several residents from Westenburg took to the streets on Monday protesting outside the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court with posters proclaiming: “Justice for Jade!”.
The suspect was arrested at the Pietersburg Provincial Hospital after he and the deceased were transported there by friends after a physical altercation.
It is suspected that the altercation led to Jade stabbing the suspect with a knife, who then retaliated with a licensed firearm and shot Jade in the chest and face. The firearm has since been confiscated by law enforcement officials.
The motive behind the altercation is still unknown at this point.
The suspect, Mpho Matamela has been granted bail which was set at R3 000 and will appear in court again on 2 December.
The protestors outside the court chanted that bail be denied and expressed anger when the verdict was given.
They could not understand why he was granted bail, with some threatening to go after him.
Polokwane Observer spoke to locals on what they thought would be a suitable sanction.
