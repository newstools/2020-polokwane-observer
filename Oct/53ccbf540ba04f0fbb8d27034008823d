Eight years after it was destroyed in a blaze, construction is currently underway at the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court at a cost of close to R100 million.
The site handover was done on 17 October 2019 and the anticipated practical completion is on 16 October 2021.
The court burned down on 19 October 2012 after a fire broke out and the ground floor was completely gutted, with only a portion of the basement structure not having been affected.
Court documents and equipment were destroyed in the fire, which took the fire brigade more than three hours to extinguish.
At the time of the incident, several high-level cases were being heard.
All these cases were subsequently moved to Mankweng, Seshego, Ga-Matlala and Mokopane.
Public Works Media Liaison Officer, Thami Mchunu, says the features to be included in the construction of the court consist of mechanical equipment, security features, fire equipment, ICT and electrical features.
“There are no plans to add any additional features, we are currently just in the process of reconstructing the building,” Mchunu said.
According to Mchunu, construction could only start once the forensic investigations, funding strategy and building designs were completed.
A case of arson was recorded at the time, but comment from Police Spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo on the matter was still being awaited at at the time of going to press.
