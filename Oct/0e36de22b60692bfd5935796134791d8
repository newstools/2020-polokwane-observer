‘I can’t recall’ proved to be the repeated answer to a range of questions put to Rameez Patel on Friday in the trial of the murder of his wife, Fatima.
She was found murdered in 2015.
After several postponements, cross-examination finally got underway in the Polokwane High Court last week.
Advocate for the state Lethabo Mashiane, focused largely on events that occurred on the day of the murder.
Patel, questioned in relation to earlier testimony by his brother, Razeen, according to which Rameez supposedly “covered his tracks”, he once more said he couldn’t recall this testimony.
He also couldn’t say why certain information was not disputed earlier.
Questioned on his movements on the day, which Patel also couldn’t corroborate saying it was human nature to forget certain things, Judge Joseph Raulinga responded by saying that on the contrary, having been questioned so often on the events by now, human nature would have been to remember instead.
Patel’s representative, Advocate Thipe, was rebuked on more than one occasion for interrupting the cross-examination by wanting to answer questions on behalf of his client.
Patel, Raulinga said, had been part of the proceedings all along and should have objected earlier had he felt it was needed.
Raulinga cautioned Patel, saying he was being argumentative and evasive during cross-examination.
The trial will commence in December.
