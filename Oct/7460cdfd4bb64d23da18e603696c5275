The four accused in the murder case of Lizette Deacon, and her mother, Hettie Deacon have been remanded in custody until Wednesday, 7 October when they will re-appear in the local magistrate’s court for bail application.
The postponement of the matter was due to a change in legal representation of the suspects including Sophie Mmako, who was employed by Lizette Deacon as a domestic worker.
Mmako appeared with her fellow accused Lazarus Mahlo, Advanced Amid and Casper Mudau on two counts of murder and two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances.
They were arrested following a 72-hour activation plan after Lizette and Hettie were found murdered on the R37 on the evening of 10 Spetember. The mother and daughter were reported missing by a neigbour earlier that day.
Police Spokesperson Brigadier Motlalefa Mojapelo has urged the community to assist in the arrest of one last suspect, known as Owen who goes by the surname Setsiba, Makutara or Mbedzi.
“Anyone with information about his whereabouts is requested to contact Lieutenant Colonel Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501 or Sergeant Phaladi Makola at 082 749 2233 or the Crime stop number 0860010111.”
It is believed that Owen has information that is vital to the investigation. The police have also offered a reward of R250 000 for anyone that can assist in the arrest and conviction of Owen.
Department of Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale says she is pleased that the suspects are still in custody and she hopes bail would be denied. Rakgoale has continued to offer support to the Deacon family and has attended every court appearance.
