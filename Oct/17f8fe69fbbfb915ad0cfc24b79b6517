All leads are being followed after the murder of two women in the Magna Via industrial area in the city on Saturday.
Seven people have been brutally murdered in the city since 11 September and in the latest incident, two businesswomen were shot at pointblank range at around 10:00 while sitting in their vehicle.
Makoena Leshabane (46) and Tebogo Mphuti (35) were at the time viewing vacant properties for business purposes. According to the police, three men were responsible for the crime, while a fourth waited in a getaway vehicle which has been identified as a red Hyundai sedan with Gauteng registration plates.
“The three suspects, two armed with firearms, accosted the two women seated in their vehicle and shot them. They were killed instantly,” Police Spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed.
According to the police, the suspects then fled the scene in the Hyundai. The motive for the killing will be determined by the unfolding police investigations.
More CCTV footage was made available to the police earlier this week. The police have since launched a manhunt for the suspects and are calling for anyone with information to contact Brig James Espach at 082 576 0743 or Lt Col Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501 or the Crime Stop number 08600 10111.
