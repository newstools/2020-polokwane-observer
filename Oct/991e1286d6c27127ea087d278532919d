Limpopo Tourism Agency (LTA) was announced as the top Gender-Empowerment Organisation at the 17th Annual Standard Bank Top Women Awards 2020 held in Gauteng recently.
The awards honour organisations whose unfailing vision and innovative leadership have positively impacted women in South Africa.
In response to the unprecedented global pandemic, the awards have moved to become completely virtual.
In her acceptance speech Chief Executive Officer of LTA, Nomasonto Ndlovu said the award was unexpected and she is humbled to be recognised. “I would like to thank the team and all the women in Limpopo as we would have not made it without their support and wished everyone a great recovery period after Covid-19.” The event was also aimed at recognising those accelerating transformation and creating awareness around women empowerment while also facilitating discussions and workshops around furthering gender empowerment in the country.
