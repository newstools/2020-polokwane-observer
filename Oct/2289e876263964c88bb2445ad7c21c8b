Nikkel Street in Nirvana is known for flooding when it rains heavily.
For the past few years, motorists have had to avoid the street as the water levels rise and flood the area.
According to Municipal Spokesperson, Thipa Selala, the pipes along that road need to be upgraded and that requires a capital budget from the IDP.
The municipality is aware of the problem and the area falls within roads that have been identified together with six other areas in the city.
“The budget allocation for the current financial year has been completed. These areas will have to go through IDP so that they can be budgeted for and get repaired.”
