Time to Care and Road Hogs Pietersburg charity organisations, through their social outreach programmes, handed over food parcels to job seekers in Polokwane last Thursday.
The food parcels included a scrumptious rice meal, served with chicken, vegetables and nutritious soup.
Mehmet Bas from Time to Care said that with the gesture, they wanted to give job seekers hope.
“Job-hunting is a difficult thing to do and one can imagine how difficult it can be on an empty stomach. With the meals we wanted to give them hope, strength and we are saying to them they must not give up.”
One of the job seekers,Walter Lesoga, was thankful for the gesture.
“Being unemployed, it is difficult to provide for yourself and your loved ones. We are treated like outcasts. We have been rejected by society and rely on piece jobs for survival. Sometimes we go for a month without a job. The two organisations must continue with the good initiative and reach out to more people.”
