This year was not a highlight for avid rugby players who put their hearts and souls into training and being hopeful for a place in the provincial and even national teams. Since no sport was allowed during the natiowide lockdown, there were also no matches, no trails and no camps.
Three friends from Tom Naudé Technical High School received news that they will be able to play for the South African Barbarians in France in January 2021. Polokwane Observer met up with them.
Ashwyn Rogers, Andy Meso and Brent Janse van Vuuren were part of Tommie’s u/15 squad at the beginning of the year.
Ashwyn and Andy started their rugby journeys at Laerskool Pietersburg-Noord Primary where Andy played for the first team while Brent played his first match for Oosskool and later joined Pietersburg Laerskool where he was selected for the first team.
Ashwyn captained Noordskool’s second team while Andy was the captain for the first two matches of 2020 at Tom Naudé.
Brent is a scrumhalf while Andy plays flank both open and blind side and Ashwyn plays wing and fullback.
Ashwyn first played for Limpopo in 2018 and even though Andy never played for Limpopo, he says it would be an honour. “It would be an honour to play Craven Week for Limpopo Blue Bulls but once again it’s all about self-discipline, hard work, and determination.”
Brent participated in both in the Konka Rugby Week and Bokkie Week. “The best part of playing rugby is to pull that jersey over my head and play with my team that is like my family. The worst part is when someone is injured,” Brent says.
Ashwyn likes the fact that you get to play as a team and celebrate victories as a team. “It is a team sport and not an individual sport.
For Andy achieving a goal as a team is the best. “As well as leading your team to victory. I hate it when I do not give it my all in a match or when I don’t have a good game . All three players dream of receiving a bursary to keep on playing.
