Some people die at 18 but are only buried at 80. With these words motivational speaker Dr Putswana Senoamadi addressed parents and learners at Noorderland High School’s Excellence Awards ceremony recently. Senoamadi moved on by explaining how all problems can be solved if one just uses his/her mind and time wisely.
“Attitude has three G’s. The first G is Growth which you gather by perusing wisdom. Then there is Generosity. You need to be able to serve others. The last G is Gratitude. Say thank you for what you have and get.”
Student Government Body Chairperson, Lesiba Ramatsokotla thanked the learners, staff and parents for their hard work during the past few months. “Our goal is to support our school’s vision and mission and the learners in front of me made us proud. We encourage them to keep their focus on their work. This year was not 2020, it was 20 plenty, we got way more than what we bargained for. Thank you.”
