It only took a number of calls and posts on social media by local farmer and Rotarian, Peter Mockford, for 1 500 bales of lucern and other essential items to be donated and delivered to farmers in the Free State.
Mockford, who volunteered the first 300 bales of lucern, received the donations within two days and it will be given to farmers who were affected by devastating veld fires in the province last week.
Retired farmer, Harri Harmse from Ysterberg then took the lead and on Saturday, 24 October, two interlink trucks transporting the lucern as well as medication to the value of R30 000 departed from Mockford Farms outside the city and arrived in Boshoff and Hertzogville in the Free State on Sunday after a 678km trip.
The trucks were made available free of charge by Wynand Swanepoel of Elban Logistics in Mokopane and all the diesel required was donated by Lee Janse van Rensburg of Enco Filling Station in Polokwane. According to Gerrie Goosen, a farmer who organised the transport, an amount of R71 600 was also donated to assist with expenses.
A consignment of packs containing food and essential items were also packed by the Anns of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 and delivered to AfriForum’s local depot in the city on Sunday from where it will be dispatched to the Free State. The Rotarians contributed R30 000 in cash.
President of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100, Naas Vorster said the Rotarians are deeply touched by the fate of the farmers and that the donations are only a small gesture to show solidarity. “Every drop helps and we encourage other organisations to contribute as well,” he said.
