The police in Polokwane are yet to make an arrest following the murder of 80-year-old Jakkie Grobler in Koraal retirement village last week, but a man has been identified who may be able to assist in the ongoing investigations.
Grobler’s body was discovered at her home on Monday, 21 September around 11:00, according to an earlier statement by Police Spokesperson, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo.
Police are requesting the assistance of the man who has been identified as ‘Legonya Thamsadu’. Reports suggest that the man was usually seen in the area of Dorp and Suid streets and can therefore assist them.
Mojapelo said anyone with information, can contact Brig James Esbach at 082 576 0743, the Crime Stop number at 08600 10111 or their nearest police station.
