The Polokwane Municipality currently receives half of its licensed water supply from the Ebenezer Dam and the Olifantspoort plant.
The Acting Manager in the Water Department, Meshack Thaba says the municipality is licensed to receive 48 megalitres of water daily from Olifantspoort, but is currently only receiving 24 megalitres.
The Seshego Dam is only supplying 1 megalitre per day and the Dap Naudé Dam 14 megalitres.
Pilgrim’s Hoop supplies 1,2 megalitres daily and the combined municipal boreholes only provide 6,9 megalitres of water daily.
Thaba says the current water supply is not sufficient as it usually amounts to 69,4 megalitres out of the 110 mega litres needed to supply both the urban and rural areas of the city.
Although the municipality has introduced a water tanker system Thaba believes it is not sustainable and should only seen as an interim measure.
“The water tankers are only meant to provide temporary relief.
“We have about 21 water tankers rotating in the area of which seven provide water to the Pietersburg Provincial Hospital, Seshego Hospital and Mediclinic Limpopo.”
The municipality has instructed the water tankers team to not fill up large tanks in an effort to ensure that there is enough water for every resident.
According to Thaba, it is illegal for residents to open fire hydrants even if there is a water shortage. “The hydrants are the property of the Fire Department and only they are permitted to use it. Anyone caught opening a fire hydrant will be fined for illegal water use. This also includes watering your garden and washing your vehicle.”
He says residents have a few alternatives which include using their own boreholes, getting water from the Flora Park Dam, visiting the water workshop or the Dalmada purification plant.
Residents can simply visit any of these sources to have their containers filled up, he said.
