The President of Action Aquatics Swimming Academy, Gordon Ferns, says the establishment of the academy will revive the sport in Polokwane.
Ferns said Polokwane used to be the hub of swimming in the early 2000s but the legacy waned as the years went by.
“In early 2000, Polokwane was the top swimming town in Limpopo and we want to bring that back. We want to make Polokwane the hub of swimming again. We have many talented swimmers and they need a broader swimming platform, hence we decided to start the academy.
“We aim to produce top swimmers that will compete on international levels,” Ferns said.
The newly established academy boasts 30 swimmers who will be competing in their inaugural local swimming gala penciled for Bela-Bela on 30 October.
The academy has acquired the services of 2016 Limpopo Sportsman of the Year Award winner, Ude Fuchs as the head coach.
Fuchs competed in many international swimming events and finished sixth in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 49,68 seconds at the 2018 GLIAC Championships.
Ferns added that they are happy to have Fuchs at the helm of the club and pointed out that his experience will catapult the academy to greater heights.
“Ude was a brilliant swimmer and he holds many records in Limpopo. Swimming was part of his life for a long time and we are happy to have him in the academy. This is his way of giving back to swimming.”
Fuchs said he was happy to be part of the initiative that will allow swimmers to shine and broaden their swimming talent.
“This is my first coaching chapter and career. I am enjoying every moment of it and I enjoy coaching and helping children. We have few performers at the academy but most of them are unfit due to the lengthy layoff as a result of Covid-19, they will need a month or two to get into good shape but I believe they will do well at the gala.”
