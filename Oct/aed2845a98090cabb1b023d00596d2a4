The Polokwane tennis courts were buzzing this weekend as the province’s best junior players battled it out in the Limpopo ProKennex Open Championship.
A total of 68 players came face-to-face with their opponents in a series of matches (with the exception of the Girls u/10 group).
The top-scoring players of the first day then competed in the finals.
The tournament organiser, Frikkie Eloff said the event was a huge success and shows that the city’s tennis courts are ready and able to host similar events.
According to one of the parents present, Deon de Jager, it was a great two days even though strict Covid-19 regulations applied in terms of spectators.
Parents, however, made the best of their spots in the parking area and around the grounds to ensure sure they do not miss out on any action.
Ernest Faver from the Polokwane Tennis Club complimented the efforts made by the organisers and said he received ample compliments from visitors and locals on the excellent facilities. “Everyone can be proud of the tennis club, and we are surely looking forward to hosting more events of this size.”
