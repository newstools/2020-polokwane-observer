In their quest of staying competitive in the Premier Soccer League (PSL), Baroka Football Club renewed the contracts of key players Thediso Patjie and Namibian international, Ananias Gebhardt, on Monday.
Patjie joined Baroka in 2018 from the National First Division outfit, Mbombela United Football Club and was part of the team for the Telkom Knockout title.
Gebhardt has more than 35 international caps for Namibia and he has been consistent on the pitch since joining the club two seasons ago.
Head coach, Daylan Kerr has praised the two players for their work ethic for the past two seasons.
“We had an obligation to renew their contracts.
“They have good attitudes and have shown true character. Their individual abilities have also improved and those are the things players should have,” concluded Kerr.
