The Polokwane traffic licensing and testing station on Tuesday received a thumbs-up for compliance during a visit by the MEC for Transport, Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya, the Premier, Chupu Mathabatha and the Mayor, Thembi Nkadimeng.
With the country’s move to lockdown level three services at the centre resumed on Monday. For institutions to receive the compliance go-ahead, they have to meet certain requirements of being virus-free, meaning they would have to disinfect the operating space, check temperatures and observe social distancing.
There was proper control of movement into the centre with customers being assisted in groups of 16 in order to maintain their social distance and adhere to regulations.
“Here in Ladanna, we are confident that the requirements have been met. “The National Traffic Information System (eNaTIS) system is online and people are able to book their learner and driver licence appointments,” said Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala.
During this time, priority is given to those who applied for assistance prior to the lockdown. Motorist who have to renew expired licences will also be given priority to renew, despite being given 90 days to renew.
