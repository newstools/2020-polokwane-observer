Sassa Limpopo in total received 787 646 applications for the Social Relief of Distress grant.
Spokesperson Norman Kutama says some applicants were not successful after not having met the set criteria for the R350 grant.
This grant, he said, was meant for citizens who are not currently working and who are not receiving any other form of financial assistance from government, including NSFAS beneficiaries, social grant beneficiaries and those registered with the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
One resident who had applied for a grant told Polokwane Observer that she had been kicked out of the application system.
“When I logged onto the system, it alerted me that I did not qualify for the grant, although I am not currently working. I did try to speak to Sassa officials on why it happened but I was not able to get a response.”
Kutama confirmed that Sassa does receive enquiries daily, and clarified that persons who were previously employed can only be rejected if they or their previous employer have claimed UIF.
“This happens because the applicant has been registered for UIF, and they should claim their benefits for UIF. People who receive social grants or other benefits from government institutions such as UIF or private entities, do not qualify for the Covid-19 grant.”
According to Kutama, Sassa verifies the information of applicants using their ID numbers.
“Successful applicants will be approved for payment on a monthly basis. It will not be necessary to re-apply every month as the system is automated and once you are approved payment will be made to you directly.”
The R350 payments will be made to successful beneficiaries every month until October 2020, and there is no need to reapply.
Kutama says applicants can contact Sassa at 0800 60 10 11 for more clarity.
