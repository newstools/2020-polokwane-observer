The MEC for Economic Development, Environment and Tourism, Thabo Mokone visited the Seshego Circle Centre on Monday, 1 June in a bid to monitor compliance after the nationwide lockdown was eased into level three.
The visit took place after the MEC observed the sanitising of the department’s provincial offices before employees return for duty.
A senior operator in charge of the process, Arno Swart told Polokwane Observer the process usually takes a day, during which no person is allowed into the building.
In his visit to the Circle Centre, Mokone visited Shoprite Liqour store where he was met by the Manager Vani Chengalroyan, who said the store had received an overwhelming number of customers yesterday.
“We are complying with all the set regulations, and the customers have also been adhering to the regulations,” he said. Sandra Mohlabi-Moyo, Circle Centre Manager said the centre has been working with the managers of the various stores to ensure compliance.
She said the centre would be closing off all its entrances weekly at 16:00, where those on the premises will be allowed to finish their shopping before the stores close at 17:00.
Mokone reminded liquor shoppers that they are only allowed to consume their purchases in the confines of their homes.
