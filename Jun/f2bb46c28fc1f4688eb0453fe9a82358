Local football supporters believe the aspirations of the owner of the Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila Football Club, Masala Mulaudzi to acquire a Premier Soccer League (PSL) club will boost the economy of the province.
It has been widely reported that Mulaudzi is in the process of purchasing a PSL club and once the deal is done the club will relocate to Limpopo.
Mulaudzi recently announced on a local radio station that he sold Tshakhuma, which was campaigning in the GladAfrica Championship Championship, for R10 million to an undisclosed buyer from Limpopo and was planning to top the money so he could buy the status of a PSL club.
Muluadzi was quoted in an interview to have said the reason for selling the club was prompted by his five year plan that was put in place when the club was established in 2014.
Local football supporter, Sibanda Tshilidzi said the envisaged deal will boost local economy as informal and formal traders as well as the tourism industry will immensely benefit from locally played matches. “We will have four teams in the PSL and that will be good for the economy. Hawkers rely immensely on the matches. They will be able to trade at the stadium every week during mid-week and weekend matches.”
Lefuno Monewa who is also a football supporter said the deal will change the football landscape in the province. “Limpopo will be a hive of activity. Aspiring soccer players will no longer have to travel to Gauteng and Kwa-Zulu Natal for trials and other other football related opportunities. They will be spoilt for choice and that is what we want. We want to see progress and life changing initiatives. We wish him all the best in his venture.”
Contacted for comment Tshidino Ndou, Marketing and Communications Manager for the club said he could not comment but referred Polokwane Observer to the interview Mulaudzi had on radio.
