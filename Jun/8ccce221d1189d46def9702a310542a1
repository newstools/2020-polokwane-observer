For as long as he can remember Sam Seabi, or Groot Sam as he is known in the golf circles, has been a caddy. His office is the greens at the Polokwane Golf Club. His colleagues, other caddies as well as golfers who support him with tips or something cold after a round can attest to this.
Sam is a family man who works hard to care for his family. But because of the nation-wide lockdown, no golf is being played, which makes taking care of this family nearly impossible.
On Saturday, Sam and his fellow caddies, all received a hamper with food, some clothes and cash or vouchers to use to buy food.
“This means a lot to me. I am very thankful for this as I can now feed my family,” he says.
The Polokwane Golf Club executive members, with the help of club members, businesspeople and other interested parties helped to raise these food parcels and vouchers to assist the caddies.
Wynand Pretorius, Club Captain, explained this was the second donation during lockdown the caddies received.
“This is their only income as they cannot claim UIF. We try to help them as they only work for tips. They only get paid for the days they work and due to the regulations, no golf is taking place therefore they cannot work.”
In the meantime, the Polokwane Golf Club is ready to open as soon as they receive the green light from the Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture.
“There are six people living on the course, keeping the greens maintained. Even though we might be able to open soon, our bar and kitchen will remain closed. We would like to thank everyone who contributed to the donations.
“We are also looking into the option of creating a caddies fund, which assist caddies if they are not able to earn an income,” Wynand concluded.
