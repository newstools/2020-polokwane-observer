Crime fighters of Mighty Tactical Reaction Service (MTRS) continue to give back to their community. On Saturday they ploughed back into the community in the form of marshalling free of charge during the Taxila Secondary School fun run in Nirvana.
Learners and educators of Taxila got to test their fitness during the event that provided a good running session as well as an aerobics session held on the school premises.
The event formed part of the school’s efforts to promote a balance between a healthy diet and regular physical activity among learners, educators, parents and members of the community.
MTRS Managing Director Shabier Valjie indicated that serving the community without expecting something in return was their way of saying thank you.
“We marshalled the event to ensure the safety of participants and with the help of a local ambulance service monitored any injuries,” Valjie said.
Several crime fighters and at least seven MTRS vehicles were used to ensure the success of the event and to maintain a safe environment throughout the race.
