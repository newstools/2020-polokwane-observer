Members of the community in Nirvana are seemingly feverishly engaged in raising and distributing much needed humanitarian aid to locations in the city and elsewhere in the province through efforts that were kick-started even before a lockdown announcement was official.
A member of the community of Nirvana engaged in ongoing efforts to collect food, clothing and hygiene packs for distribution purposes referred to a joint initiative having been launched prior to the day lockdown was announced with hampers being made up for drop-off initially in Nirvana and the drive then extended to Westenburg and the homeless in Polokwane. Since, different organisations in the suburb have gotten involved officially, it was learnt.
The woman, who opted to remain anonymous, mentioned drop-offs at the showgrounds in Polokwane, where a group of homeless people is being taken care of, as well as in Tzaneen planned for today (Tuesday) and in Musina to follow at a later stage. She stressed that all efforts were being coordinated within set protocols and prescribed guidelines and that they were ensuring not to break any rules or contravene any regulations.
She concluded saying the need was dire and that assistance was being directed towards anyone in need of help, irrespective of race or religion.
Members of the public wanting to support the cause or make contributions towards the disaster management efforts can dial Azizur Rahman Randera of the Polokwane Muslim Welfare Fund on 066 094 4494.
