Vodacom through the Vodacom Foundation is investing in excess of R2.5 million to procure 20 000 school stationery packs to be donated to learners from selected disadvantaged communities across all nine provinces.
The donation is part of a range of interventions Vodacom is implementing to enhance the quality of education in the Vodacom 3000 schools, including 13 schools of excellence scattered across all nine provinces.
According to Imran Khan, Managing Executive for Vodacom Limpopo Region: “Vodacom recognises that it has a particular responsibility and a profound opportunity to provide societal value through our core business activities.
“We are active in the education space and by investing in school stationery packs targeted at disadvantaged schools. This gesture will go a long way to helping children from impoverished backgrounds. We are giving the learners tools to help them succeed in their school work. This is in line with our vision to improve learner’s performance at school,” Khan said.
The Vodacom Foundation has an annual budget of approximately R110 million per annum for corporate social investment projects, and just over 60% of the budget goes into education projects.
“At the heart of our Foundation is the belief that our existing technology can be an enabler to the provision of quality education,” he concluded.
