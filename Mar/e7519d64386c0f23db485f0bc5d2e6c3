Suppliers play a vital role in Pick n Pay Cycad’s supply chain and without their ongoing support, this retailer will not be able to maintain adequate stock levels, ensuring that its customers are provided with food and other merchandise that are necessary to sustain a healthy living.
These suppliers include farmers, food processors, transporters and merchandisers as well as businesses maintaining the equipment necessary to ensure compliance with health regulations and are all making it possible for the business to keep its doors open.
