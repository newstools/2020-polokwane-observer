The Polokwane Muslim Welfare Foundation recently donated aid to institutions in and around Mankweng.
The first visit was to the Kwelano Bohloko Old Age and Disability Centre where hampers consisted of 400 kg of food items such as mielie meal, samp, rice and canned food. This centre houses elderly and individuals with disabilities from in and around the area.
The organisation then moved on to Moletjie where a clinic and a crèche were assisted. Water tanks and sanitary ware were donated, as well as 136 blankets, planting seeds, and soup packs. This will alleviate the cold for the kids as the winter season draws near. Toys were also donated to the crèche.
The Polokwane Muslim Welfare Foundation strives to and prides itself in serving the communities of the province and assisting the destitute.
