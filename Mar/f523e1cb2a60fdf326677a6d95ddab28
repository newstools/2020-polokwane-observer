Some retailers in the city do not only provide sanitisers to shoppers when entering their shops, but also promote social distancing by marking the waiting areas at shop entrances to clearly indicating waiting spaces that are one metre apart.
Shoppers are advised to maintain distancing.
When visiting Cycad Shopping Centre this morning (Monday) just before noon, the parking area was filled to capacity and shoppers queued up to the parameter of the premises, obeying the “roadmarks” along the walkways to the shop entrances. It appeared that most of the shoppers were elderly people utilising their Sassa grant money. An elderly woman in the queue said that she welcomed the initiative. “People tend to unintentionally invade the personal spaces of others and the markings now sensitise us to keep a safe distance,” she said.
Inside shops, it appeared that stocks, with the exception of sanitisers, were replenished.
