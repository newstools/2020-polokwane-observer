The province has recorded its 11th Covid-19 case as of yesterday (Saturday).
During his update national Health Minister Zwele Mkhize confirmed that by yesterday the total number of persons tested positively for the virus had increased to 1 187.
“We must out rightly state that these numbers do not indicate a reduction of the number of infections. It is merely a reflection of positive results that were received, verified and read for today’s reporting. We have noted with concern a number of confirmed cases of health workers both in the private and public sector,” Mhkize emphasised and added that these cases include nursing staff as well as medical doctors.
Some of these cases include a medical expert from Limpopo that tested positive following his return from abroad. According to Mkhize the affected doctor immediately upon experiencing symptoms  went into self-isolation. The Minister said the 14-day quarantine period had lapsed and that the department was pleased that his results have now been confirmed negative.
He further cite examples from the Free State where three  doctors, a nurse and neuro-physicist had all tested positive. Most of them, he said, were in good condition with the exception of a 70-year-old doctor who is in intensive care.
Mkhize  further reported that the South Africans repatriated from Wuhan in China earlier this month would be going home after spending a 14 day isolation period at Protea Hotel Ranch Resort. They all passed a second set of tests, he indicated.
He then thanked the Provincial Government for its assistance in accommodating these persons and said: “We also thank the resort and all its workers who were prepared to sacrifice to serve our compatriots despite the threats of the pandemic.
