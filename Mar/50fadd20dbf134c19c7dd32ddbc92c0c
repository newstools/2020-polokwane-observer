The organisers of the annual Ebenezer Mile which was scheduled for this Saturday at the Ebenezer Dam outside Haenertsburg informed that the event has been cancelled after President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement on the Coronavirus on Sunday.
One of the organisers and secretary of the Rotary Club of Haenertsburg, Robin Gardner indicated that unfortunately they have to take the President’s directive and not host the event as scheduled.
In a press statement she said that organisers are applying to Swim South Africa (SSA) to look at their calendar for a new date later in the year when the virus is no longer a threat.
“We thank everyone for their support and understanding and ask that this message is shared with all contacts who are likely to be affected by this event being cancelled in the short-term. We will keep all stakeholders informed as we go forward.”
