As a way of teaching children to love and care for one another, Eagle’s Nest Christian School Life Orientation educator Mike Moutlana celebrated his 65th birthday with the Grade 3 learners at the institution on Monday.
Sharing his birthday cake with junior learners has been the norm for Moutlana since he joined the school in 2014. He emphasised that his heart was with the young ones and that he made a point of celebratng his birthday with them annually. Moutlana who has been in the education fraternity for 44 years now indicated that he chose teaching because he loved sharing knowledge, skills and information with children.
He shares his birth date with two learners, Lesedi Phasha and Siphesihle Sikhosana, who also shared their birthday cakes with fellow learners. Moutlana stressed that sharing was an important thing and reiterated that children had to be taught to share at an early age to grow into better people. He urged educators to keep sharpening their minds and stay informed to excel in their respective subjects.
“Educators should read a lot and always strive to guide the young ones on life skills and be passionate about what they do. Love what you do and do what you love most. The Department of Education must take care of educators by equipping them with relevant tools of trade. Learners should also work hard to become the best. They should get lost in their books and seek assistance where necessary to learn,” Moutlana explained.
