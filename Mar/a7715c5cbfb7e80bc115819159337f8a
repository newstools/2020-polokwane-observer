A local community structure operating as Polokwane Muslim Disaster Management Organisation joined forces with Mighty Tactical Reaction Services, an operator in the security industry, this afternoon (Tuesday) to collect and deliver food and other essential items to community members in need.
Members of the organisation met at a mosque in Nirvana from where they departed to various points in the city where items were to be collected for delivery.
One of the organisers of the initiative, Azizur Rahman said that members of the Muslim community of Nirvana identified a need for extending a hand of help to fellow members of the community and decided to establish the Polokwane Muslim Disaster Management Organisation to co-ordinate the efforts to reach out to people in need.
