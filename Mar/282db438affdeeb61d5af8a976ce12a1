In an effort to contain the spread of the Corona virus, a joint operation of the provincial sector departments and Polokwane and Capricorn District municipalities will see the homeless people in the city and surrounds being relocated to the Polokwane Showgrounds just outside the city as soon as all logistical arrangements are in place.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed earlier this morning (Friday) that The Red Cross will provide food to the people and that the facilities at the Jack Botes Hall kitchens will be utilised to prepare meals. “The municipality is currently busy to ensure that asequate water, electricity and sanitation as well as enough shelter will be available,” Mothapo said. He did not indicate when the relocation will commence, but assured that the matter is treated with the utmost expedience.
