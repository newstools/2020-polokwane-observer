Charity Makwela’s combination of beauty and brains stole the show on Saturday and she was subsequently crowned as Face of Savannah 2020. Families of the contestants and shoppers gathered at Savannah Mall’s Banking Mall on Saturday to witness the auspicious event.
The theme of the event was Metallic, Gems and Jewels and the dress code cocktail/party dress. Contestants competed in the Petite (four to six years), Junior (seven to nine years), Pre-Teen (10 to 12 years), Teen (13 to 16 years) and Miss (17 to 25 years) years) categories.
The pageant kicked off on a high note with the Petite. The adorable models had the audience eating from their hands with their feisty catwalk personalities. After the little ones broke the ice, each age group had the opportunity to walk down the runway. They also had to answer tricky questions that the judges took turns to ask. During short breaks, the crowd was entertained by K-Slash, dancers from the Fun Dance Company and Gym Stars Gymnastics, Trigga SA – The Greatest and karatekas from Yin Yang Karate and Self-Defence Studio.
Makwela, will be supported by her first princess, Nsovo Ngwenya and second princess, Tamryn Terblanche.
