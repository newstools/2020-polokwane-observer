Toddlers at Mitchell House Squirrel’s Nest took part in a challenging project to turn young engineers into big builders over the last two weeks.
The toddlers were divided into groups of 12 and had the opportunity to develop their creative skills during two sessions for every group, using flexible pieces to assemble 3D models. Themes included an amusement park, animals, aircrafts and transportation and the toddlers chose to go with animals and make spiders.
Educator Rosy Lopes said that the activity provided a hands-on educational experience. “It exposed the learners to engineering terminology as well as terms taken from the animal kingdom. They developed self-learning skills, both in terms of building technique and knowledge and also enhanced communication skills,” she explained.
