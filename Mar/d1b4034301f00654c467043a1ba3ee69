Residents of Our Home/Ons Tuiste were not forgotten when members of the Bikers community and the Rotary clubs of Polo­kwane and Pietersburg 100 hosted the annual Bikers Breakfast at the institution on Saturday.
The sumptuous breakfast consisted of pap and gravy, poached eggs, fried mushrooms, crispy bacon and buttered rolls with a selection of jams, rounded off with coffee and tea.
A cash bar and stalls with gifts, pan cakes, vegetables and other refreshments contributed to the festive atmosphere and on the way out, visitors took advantage of the bargains that were up for grabs at the white elephant table.
