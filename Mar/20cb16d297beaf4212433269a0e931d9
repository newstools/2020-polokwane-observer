Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects involved in a recent business robbery at a distribution company in the industrial area of Mokopane.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that a dedicated joint task team comprising of Mokopane detectives and members of the Crime Intelligence Unit had been hard at work tracing the suspects.
It is alleged that on 3 January at about 01:10 about seven suspects wearing balaclavas confronted a 56-year-old security guard at the company, threatened him with a firearm and tied him up with wire. The suspects then reportedly broke into the store and used a grinder to open two safes whereupon they allegedly managed to get away with more than R300 000 in cash as well as a footage device and laptop, according to Mojapelo.
After the suspects fled the scene the Police were notified and started with initial investigations. Two blasting cartridges and five electric detonators were also found in the bush nearby, according to Mojapelo.
Police are appealing to the person appearing in the photograph to avail himself at Mokopane Police Station to assist with investigations.
