Police have launched a manhunt for a middle-aged man in connection with several charges of fraud allegedly committed in the Modimolle area as well as certain areas in Gauteng between September 2011 and February 2019.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that suspect reportedly defrauded farmers of an undisclosed amount of money after pretending to be selling Lucerne bales to farmers who were experiencing challenges during the drought on their farms.
He allegedly requested deposits of thousands of Rands but never delivered to product to farmers.
Mojapelo added that the suspect is also facing three unrelated fraud charges in Modimolle and Randburg and a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm in Modjadjiskloof.
Police followed up on information received and traced the suspect at his hide-out in the Brits area last Monday but he managed to evade arrest and has been gone since then.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect was last seen collecting his children from school and had since disappeared, according to Mojapelo.
Police are requesting Stefanus Gerhardus (Stefan) Muller (32) to report to the nearest Police station to assist with investigations of the matter.
Anyone with information is requested to contact investigating officer Amanda Rossouw on 071 133 8524 or the crime stop number on 08600 10111.
