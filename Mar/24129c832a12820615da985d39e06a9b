The case of intimidation against Ali Salman following the circulation of a video containing an alleged death threat against local businessman Shabier Valjie was not enrolled at Polokwane Magistrate’s Court as expected on Friday after the public prosecutor indicated that the court needed to be provided with more information.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo said the prosecutor’s reasons are as follows: “The video is not visible and audible enough to prove the allegations. The court need to be provided with more information. The investigation officer was then instructed to go and obtain more information (statement) from the complainant. The docket will then be taken to the public prosecutor for decision.”
Earlier Polokwane Observer reported that Salman, confirmed to be a Pakistani national and who refers to himself as “Ali G” in the video, was also sought for an immigration-related matter. A case of attempted murder of Razeen Patel, brother of double murder accused Rameez Patel, was reportedly withdrawn against him in the past.
Meanwhile, Salman’s father, Salman Hamid, who claims to be the “mafia boss” of the South African Pakistani Association in Polokwane and who faces charges of alleged contravention of South Africa’s immigration laws briefly appeared in the same court on Friday after which the matter was postponed to 30 April.
It has since November been reported that Hamid made court appearances in unrelated matters of alleged contravention of South Africa’s immigration laws. He also faces charges of common assault and intimidation following an alleged attack on Valjie at a business premises in Superbia recently that led to Hamid registering counter charges of common assault and pointing of a firearm against Valjie.
