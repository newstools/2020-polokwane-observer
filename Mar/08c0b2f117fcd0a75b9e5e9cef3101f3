A 42-year-old suspect was expected to appear in the Bela-Bela Magistrateâ€™s Court early last week after he was arrested recently on a charge of illegal cultivation of dagga at Hlalampya informal settlement.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Police had received information about the existence of the plants and members of the Crime Intelligence Unit and Visible Policing Unit swiftly responded. Upon their arrival at the premises 36 dagga plants with an estimated street value of R3 000 were discovered and confiscated. The suspect was apprehended on the spot, according to Mojapelo.
