Tree branches touching electricity cables at the corner of Sevenster and Snyman streets in Eduan Park caused a power trip this morning (Friday) at around 09:00, leaving residents in the immediate neighbourhood without electricity for more than two hours.
Before noon municipal workers that were performing essential services were activated and they arrived on the scene to cut the tree and before 13:00, electricity supply was restored.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo said that trees around electricity cables are maintained according to a schedule. “Sometimes some trees grow faster and then incidents like this one may occur,” Mothapo explained.
