The Rotary Club of Polokwane in collaboration with Care for Education donated Lego sets to a value of more than R200 000 to 8 schools and institutions in Limpopo caring for children with special needs during an event at Our Home/Ons Tuiste on Saturday.
Representatives of the institutions which included Abraham Kriel Children’s Home, Siloe School for the Blind and the TLC Oncology Ward at Pietersburg Hospital, received the 8 kg boxes from Incoming President of the Rotarians, Pierre Mouton. The recipients were workshopped by Shayne Moodie on how to make the most of the Legos, and in particular the Duplo Playbox Level 1 version.
“The aim of the donation to underprivileged children is to impact early childhood development and primary education, using concrete manipulatives which engage children in playful learning. Legos are tactile tools that not only encourage and stimulate children, but greatly accelerate the conceptualisation process and allow children to be more inventive, curious and creative,” Moodie explained.
Mouton encouraged the educators to put effort into getting the learners to explore the creative opportunities offered by the Legos.
