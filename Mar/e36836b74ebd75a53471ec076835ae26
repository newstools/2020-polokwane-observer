The Youth Enterprise Society of Taxila Secondary School were announced as the first runner-up of the Eskom Simana Ranta Entrepreneurship Education (EE) Schools Competition during the finale of the competition hosted at Westenburg Hall last Friday.
The society promotes entrepreneurship in schools and their communities. They also encourage young people to start their own businesses, create jobs and help to fight the scourge of unemployment and poverty.
For their endeavour the society walked away with a floating trophy and R25 000 in cash prize.
Motlalepula Ramalepe, Economics educator at the school congratulated the members of the society and said they were a good example to their peers.
“The society needs young minds and people who have solutions to the triple challenges. They design bags and shoes and they sell it to the community, educators and learners at the school.”
The Eskom Simama Ranta competition aims to identify, honour and showcase South African secondary schools that are exemplary in entrepreneurship education. The competition encourages learners to consider entrepreneurship as a career choice thereby taking charge of their career path by becoming job creators rather than job seekers.
