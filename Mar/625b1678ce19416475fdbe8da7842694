In the wake of continuous reported incidents of mob justice the Thohoyandou High Court on Friday handed down a hefty sentence to a man found guilty of having led a crowd during the killing of a man at Bungeni Xitachi village in January 2017.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that Yingisani Eucliff Nkuna was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder plus an additional three years for violation of a protection order in a separate incident of assault.
Ngoepe indicated that community members had accused Jackson Mkhwanazi (46) of poisoning people in the area. Nkuna led the group of angry community members who initially used sticks to assault Mkhwanazi and subsequently set him alight by using a tyre.
When Police arrived on the scene Mkhwanzi had already burnt beyond recognition.
Investigations commenced immediately and did not cease until the suspect was arrested and subsequently sentenced.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba welcomed the heavy sentence and commended the investigating officer on a job well done.â€™
