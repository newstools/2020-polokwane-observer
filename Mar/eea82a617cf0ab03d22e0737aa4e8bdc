Stanford Lake College (SLC) is particularly proud of the school’s six athletes who were selected to compete in the Mopani District Trials in NkowaNkowa last Thursday.
Lia Revelas (u.19) delivered a splendid performance in the 100 m hurdles and specifically the 400 m hurdles where she set a new provincial record of 1:04,37. She will be joined on the provincial team by Kian Noné and David Ramalepe (both u.14) who qualified for the upcoming national championships with best personal performances in the high jump and 100 m respectively.
Mada Buliani (u.19) faced some tough competition on the track and despite not running a qualifying time nevertheless attained his personal best. Devon Coad (u.16) and Hosea Muleya (u.19), narrowly missed qualification despite first-rate performances.
