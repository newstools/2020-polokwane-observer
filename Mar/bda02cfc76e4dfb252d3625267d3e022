The newly appointed Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Transport and Community Safety, Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya is anticipated to hit the ground running following her deployment as the political head of the portfolio on Monday evening.
Lerule-Ramakhanya, formerly the Speaker of the Provincial Legislature, has to fill the shoes of Dickson Masemola who has been deployed to Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure portfolio, previously held by Monica Mochadi.
MECs who retained their portfolios are Basikopo Makamu for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs, Seaparo Sekoati for Provincial Treasury, Phophi Ramathuba for Health, Polly Boshielo for Education, Nkakareng Rakgoale for Social Development, Thabo Mokone for Economic Development, Environment and Tourism, Nandi Ndalane for Agriculture and Rural Development and Thandi Moraka for Sport, Arts and Culture.
Mochadi is the only one axed from Limpopo cabinet seemingly due to poor performance as it was learnt that Premier Stan Mathabatha made the adjustments following the assessment of the performance of the Provincial Government in carrying out its constitutional mandate over the past ten months of the sixth administration.
A statement made available to Polokwane Observer quoted Mathabatha to have said that he trusted that the changes would add the required value in acceleration of the delivery of services and, more importantly, the improvement of the lives of people of Limpopo. These changes are with immediate effect, it was learnt.
Provincial Legislature Spokesperson Meodi Mothapo emphasised that the Deputy Speaker of the Legislature, Jerry Ndou is expected to lead the house until such time all due processes have been completed to elect the new Speaker.
