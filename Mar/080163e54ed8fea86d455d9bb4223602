PEPPS Preparatory School hosted a family picnic recently where learners could invite their family and friends to spend the day together.
Old and young could engage in fun activities such as water slides, jumping castle, egg and spoon race and water balloon toss.
PEPPS communication and marketing officer Millisa Naidoo said the obstacle course race was won by Rati Lerutla and her mother Yvonne.
They received a bowling voucher for two as their prize, she said.
Naidoo added that the highlight of the day was that the learners enjoyed themselves socialising and taking part in the games and later enjoyed a picnic with their families and friends. The event was a great success and contributed to creating memorable moments for learners and their families, Naidoo concluded.
