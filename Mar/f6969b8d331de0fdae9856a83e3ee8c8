Five PEPPS Preparatory School and College learners are still hopeful that they will be afforded an opportunity to compete for national colours after the postponement of the South African Schools Athletics track and field championships for both secondary and primary schools due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus (Covid-19).
Bono Neluheni (u.11), John-Ross Donovan (u.13), Oby Orjiako (u.12), Chika Mabitsela (u.19) and Ngwato Mahlatji (u.12) are still looking forward to go all out against their opponents from various schools across the country in a number of field and track events. The five are members of a group selected at the recent provincial athletics meeting held at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium. Senior athletes were set to compete from yesterday (Wednesday) until Sunday in Boksburg while the juniors were scheduled for 25 to 27 March in Bloemfontein.
A letter issued by South Africa Schools Athletics highlighted that the organisation would reconsider presenting both the secondary and primary schools championships 2020 once the schools reopen on 14 April: “Depending on the state of the country and further possible announcement by Government, we will embark on a broad consultation process to make the championships a possibility,” a letter reads.
President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday declared a national state of disaster which prohibit, among others, gatherings of 100 people or more and the immediate closing of schools until after the Easter weekend.
