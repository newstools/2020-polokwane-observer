Local cricketers recently made the province proud after they were selected for various national cricket teams and prigrammes.
Tebogo Macheke from Hammanskraal, who currently plays for Limpopo Impala Cricket senior women’s team, the Lillies, was selected for the 2020 Powerade National Women’s Academy Programme while Gerhardus Fourie, head boy at Hoërskool Merensky, made it to the South African Rural side.
Macheke reportedly thanked the coaches that helped along her cricket journey, including Lillies head coach Neo Sekokotla for giving her an opportunity to play for the team.
She was quoted to have said: “The opportunities that have been given to me make me feel blessed and honoured that I have been given a chance to participate in a higher league of cricket. I would also like to thank my family for the support they have given me over the years.”
It was learnt that Fourie, from Louis Trichardt, had won the South Africa’s fastest young bowler accolade at the Audi Q5 fast track competition in Cape Town in 2017. According to information provided by Limpopo Impala Cricket, his speed was measured at an astonishing 135,4 km/h and at the u.17 Momentum week in Durban in 2018 he was the leading wicket taker with 21 wickets in six games
He reportedly said: “I am excited and don’t know what to expect leading into the Future Cubs Week that is coming up. From my side, there is a lot of work to be done. It is always great fun and a privilege to play in these types of weeks. I will just make sure to suck up as much experience and information in as I can to improve.”
