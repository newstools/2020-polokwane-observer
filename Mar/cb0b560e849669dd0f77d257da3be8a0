Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale has today (Saturday) visited a temporary shelter for homeless people which has been established in Tzaneen.
Departmental spokesperson Witness Tiva emphasised that provincial government has established such shelters in some local municipalities across the province to cater for the homeless after the 21-day lockdown pronouncement by President Cyril Ramaphosa. This is to ensure that the homeless do not roam the streets during the 21-day lockdown period, he added.
Tiva quoted Rakgoale to have said the provincial government has heeded a call of ensuring that Covid-19 preventative measures are being adhered to. The Tzaneen temporary shelter accommodates 72 homeless people, Rakgoale stated.
According to Tiva, Rakgoale also visited a local grocery chain store to ensure that the social distancing rule is being followed.
