Local model and Miss Teenager South Africa 2020 finalist, Emily Sekepe may not have a chance to contest in the pageant final to be held in Gauteng later this year due to a lack of funds.
The lanky 15-year-old is appealing to the business community as well as individuals to assist in her pursuit of the prestigious title.
Emily, a Grade 10 learner at Bokamoso Senior Secondary School in Seshego is hoping that the R10 000 she needs to pay her entrance fee as well as transport costs to Gauteng, accommodation prior to and during the pageant as well as garments will be found.
Despite her financial predicament Emily is confident that she will bring the title back home. “I have won a couple of local pageants and I feel that I have outgrown the local market. I want to go global and face new challenges. I need funding so that I can achieve the goals that I have set for myself,” she stated.
