The regional Rotary Satellite E-club of Southern Africa D9400 – Baobab was established in the city last Thursday evening with former Rotary District Governor Grant Daly as the interim chairperson.
According to Daly, the First Rotary E-club was chartered in District 9400 (Northern South Africa, Botswana, eSwatini and Southern Mozambique) in March 2014.
“As we move into the 4th Industrial Revolution, all organisations need to re-look at how they operate.
The new age of electronic networking is with us and we have the benefit of so many affordable platforms that in this ever changing world we can now meet from the comfort of our homes,” Daly said and added that the members of this newly formed club are cognisant of the fact that it is also important to meet in person from time to time and going forward they will meet with the sponsor club once a month to maintain the link until they are chartered.
According to Daly, local meetings will be on the first and third Tuesday of every month at 17:30.
“Most founder members are seasoned Rotarians so they have already identified worthy community projects and fund raisers to consider. Bernard van den Dool is the chair elect and Kabelo Bopape was appointed as secretary.
Watch this space, I think we are going to see a lot of this club in terms of their activities,” Daly said.
