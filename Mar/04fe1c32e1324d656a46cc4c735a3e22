Three men found guilty of a series of business robberies and being part of a crime syndicate that targeted business in Moogophong and Modimolle during 2016 were handed a harsh sentence by the Mokopane Regional Court recently.
Kagiso Brian Difeto (32), Ralph Mashilo (33) and Josia Boshielo (40) were found guilty on charges ranging from business robbery, possession of unlicensed firearm, ammunition and a jamming device and receiving a stolen vehicle.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the trio had targeted cell phone stores and attacked staff members in the mornings just after opening. They would order them to load cell phones and gadgets into large bags whereafter they fled the scene. The cell phones were then sold at various places in Limpopo and Gauteng, according to Mojapelo.
But their criminal spree ended in August 2016 when two of the accused were arrested after Police received information about the vehicle the suspects used in the commission of crime. The vehicle was traced and two suspects arrested moments after they committed a robbery in Mookgophong. The third suspect was arrested during an intelligence-driven operation in the same area.
The cases were assigned to detective Ross Rossouw of Modimolle Police and through his diligent work the suspects were convicted and ultimately sentenced. All suspects were in custody since their arrest in 2016, according to Mojapelo.
Difeto was sentenced to 10 years for each of the three counts of business robbery. Mashilo and Botshielo were sentenced to six years imprisonment for receiving a stolen vehicle, eight years on each of the three counts of possession of an unlicensed firearm, four years for unlawful possession of ammunition and one year for unlawful possession of a jamming device.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has applauded the investigating team for their dedication and commitment.
