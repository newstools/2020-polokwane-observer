Lucas Sinclair (69), a former bishop of Westenburg has been sentenced to 24 years imprisonment on charges of sexual and indecent assault by the Mankweng Regional Court earlier this week.
According to Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe the bishop was arrested on several charges of sexual and indecent assault involving his congregates. Sinclair was caught in the act in January 2016 while inappropriately touching female congregates and the matter was subsequently reported to the Police, according to Ngoepe.
Cases of sexual and indecent assault were opened and assigned to the Polokwane Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) and the suspect was arrested soon after.
Police investigations later revealed that six more cases of sexual and indecent assault had occurred during 2006 and 2016. All the cases were then registered and investigated and it was found that Sinclair had reportedly targeted victims aged between 14 and 19 years, Ngoepe said.
Sinclair was convicted on charges of sexual and indecent assault as well as attempted sexual assault on 5 November last year and earlier this week sentenced by the same court to 24 years imprisonment without the option of a fine.
Acting Provincial Police Commissioner Samuel Manala welcomed the jail term and commended the Polokwane FCS for their diligence and commitment during investigations.
