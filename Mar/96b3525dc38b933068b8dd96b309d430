Drama learners of Curro Heuwelkruin once again showed excellent talent during their annual production, Tong en Taal which was presented at the school last Wednesday.
Tong en Taal has been a cultural institution at Kruinies since 2008. It started with only ten learners and has since grown into a fully-fledged annual stage production.
According to school marketer Nelmari Herbst every moment of the production is created by the drama learners. This year they took the audience on a journey of searching for identity, for who they are and where they fit into society, according to Herbst.
The dream of the project is to bring a love back to poetry and to do it creatively. It takes phenomenal talent to really understand poetry and perform it on stage, she said.
