Pietersburg English Medium Primary School (Pemps) Grade R learners celebrated the school’s 19th birthday with personnel, parents and educators at the school’s garden on Friday.
One of the longest serving staff members of the school, Louise Page said she was delighted to see the school growing every day.
Page who is the school’s secretary started with the school when it first opened its doors in 2001 with only few children.
“We started from absolute nothing. We are what we are today because of the community, the children and their parents. We pride ourselves in giving children a good foundation and making them happy,” Page said.
Headmaster, Karin Adlem described Pemps Grade R as the place of love and peace.
“This is were the future starts. So many students have passed through the school. Some are already at tertiary institutions and we would love to see them achieving all their goals,” Adlem said.
