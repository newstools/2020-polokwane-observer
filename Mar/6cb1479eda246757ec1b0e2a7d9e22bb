Limpopo has recorded three new Coronavirus (Covid-19) cases as of today (Monday) and bringing the total number to four. This after the Minister of Health Zwelini Mkhize’s announcement that South Africa now has 402 confirmed cases of Covid-19. This means there has been an increase of 128 from yesterday’s announcement, Mkhize explained.
According to information issued by departmental Spokesperson Neil Shikwambana, the three new cases are South African citizens from the Western Cape who travelled to several high risk countries in Europe earlier this month. Upon return last week, the family of three (husband, wife and a child) decided to subject themselves to self-quarantine at a private farm lodge in Lephalale, he explained.
Shikwambana further stated that the three have assured authorities that they have made no contact from the airport to the farm since they used their private vehicle and there are no workers on the farm. All of them are asymptomatic but they voluntarily tested because they came from high risk countries, he added.
