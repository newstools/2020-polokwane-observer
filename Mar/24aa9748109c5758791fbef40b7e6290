Homeless people that were rounded up and taken to Polokwane Show Grounds since Saturday are screened and if they show no signs of infection with the Corona virus, are taken to their homes where possible.
Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed that the provision of accommodation to homeless people is the municipality’s responsibility and that approximately 40 people are currently accommodated at the show grounds. “The number varies from time to time because some of the people prefer to be taken home,” Mothapo explained.
The management of the facility is a joint project of sector departments and the municipality and spokesperson for the Department of Social Development, Witness Tiva said that the homeless people that are actually work seekers from homes outside the city and do not have resources to return home, are assisted by social workers to unite with their families. The facility is there for people that are really homeless,” he explained.
During a visit to the show grounds at noon today (Monday) a mobile clinic of the Department of Health was observed outside the office buildings and health care practitioners were attending to people appearing to be part of the homeless community. The media was however not allowed to enter the facility.
