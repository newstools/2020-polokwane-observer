New Horizon School for the Intellectually Impaired’s annual ‘Voëltjiesport’ took place on Friday with learners taking part in a number of different codes.
Although the learners were divided into two teams, being the ‘Vinke’ and the ‘Duiwe’, no scores were kept as it was a social event.
Sport organiser Lizzy Vogel explained that sport was one of the ways in which their learners develop their skills.
“It is one of the things that most of them can do and it develops their social as well as life skills,” Vogel said.
