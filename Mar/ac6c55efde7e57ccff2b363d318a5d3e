With the global crisis posed by the deadly Coronavirus and South Africa having been affected as gravely as other countries worldwide, Limpopo residents have not been isolated. An urgent press briefing of the Department of Health has been scheduled for noon today (Monday) for an announcement that is being awaited. We will keep our readers updated.
As institutions of learning have started shutting down across the country and already the effects are being witnessed on business locally, Polokwane Observer will endeavour to remain open for business throughout all adversity, even if having to revert to an on-line edition only at any given point.
While observing the national state of disaster terms announced yesterday and adhering to health-related guidelines, it is still business as usual though and our team remains available on our cell phones, on the land line at the office, via email and on social media platforms.
