Police have arrested a 48-year-old suspect in connection with an attempted murder case on Friday evening outside Tzaneen and have, meanwhile, launched a manhunt for the suspects involved in the killing of another taxi owner in the Botshabelo area on Saturday evening.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe explained that during the first incident a female taxi owner aged 53 years was allegedly attacked in her house while asleep with her niece.
She was shot several times throughout her body and robbed of cash before the suspects fled the scene. Her niece escaped unharmed, according to Ngoepe, adding that the victim is still recuperating in a local hospital.
The Police were notified, responded swiftly and followed up on all possible leads subsequently leading to the arrest of the suspect within hours of the incident. The suspect is still being profiled and he may be linked to more similar incidents in the area and is expected to appear in the Bolobedu Magistrateâ€™s Court today (Monday) on a charge of attempted murder.
Meanwhile, Police in Bolobedu outside Tzaneen have launched a manhunt for the suspects involved in another taxi-related killing which occurred Saturday at about 18:30 along the gravel road between Botshabelo and Ga-Nakampe villages.
This after taxi owner Judas Moremi (55) of Ga-Boqa Village was found dead in his car with multiple gun shot wounds throughout his body. He was found sitting in the driver seat of his car which was also having a number of bullet holes, according to Ngoepe.
Anyone with information is requested to contact investigating officer Cecil Machimane on 082 451 7181 or report to the nearest Police station.
