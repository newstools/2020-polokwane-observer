Seven groups of Jabez Christian Academy learners in grades RR to 3 took part in a make-and-paint exercise at the school last Thursday.
According to principal Elana Erasmus, the aim of the event was to provide creative stimulation to the learners of the foundation phase. “Each learner had the opportunity to create his or her themed pencil holder with clay, finishing it off with a decorative touch. The activity was not only fun but it allowed the learners to top up their creative side combined with the development of their fine motor as well as planning skills,” Erasmus explained.
