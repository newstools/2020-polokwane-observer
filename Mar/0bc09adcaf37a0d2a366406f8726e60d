While Police are still investigating the cause of a fire that destroyed the Matlala Police Station on Sunday, communities can rest assured that the station will continue to provide services to them as alternative arrangements were made.
Transport and Community Safety MEC Dickson Masemola visited the station earlier this week to inspect the loss.
“The damage is very severe, such that the entire Community Service Centre has been affected.
Whilst investigations are under way, we urge members of communities from the
approximately 93 villages to continue visiting the station for any kind of policing services they may require,” Masemola reportedly
said.
A mobile Community Service Centre is in place at the station to temporarily render policing services.
Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Police have registered an inquiry after the station was completely gutted by flames.
It is understood that the fire started in the server office and immediately spread to the rest of the building.
Members on duty called the fire brigade from Polokwane while trying to use existing fire extinguishers to fight the flames but the heat was immense. None of the members were injured during the incident, Mojapelo indicated.
The Community Service Centre and the admin block were destroyed.
The detective offices were not burnt but their functionality might have be affected by the data lines that were also destroyed, Mojapelo said.
He added that there were nine prisoners being detained in the holding cells at the time and all were evacuated from the building unharmed.
It is suspected that the fire might have been caused by an electrical fault.
