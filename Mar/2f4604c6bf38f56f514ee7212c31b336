Members of the Executive Council (MECs) are expected to be out in full force today (Monday) to monitor social grants paypoints and shops across the province.
As social grants fall under the mandate of Social Development portfolio, MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale has this morning set the pace by monitoring the payment of social grants to older persons and people living with disabilities at the Lenyenye Post Office and retail shops at Maake Plaza and Mathlakung Plaza in Maruleng.
It was reported that there are about 2,5 million older persons and people living with disabilities in Limpopo who are beneficiaries of social grants. Seven other MECs and Premier Stan Mathabatha have been deployed to other paypoints to monitor the situation.
Rakgoale has reportedly expressed concern at the large number of people still visiting retail stores and that other grant beneficiaries are queueing for grants today, than older age and disability grant recipients.
“It was made clear by government that today and tomorrow we are only paying those specific grants so as to ensure lesser people in queues to ensure social distancing. We urge grant recipients to work with us in this regard,” Rakgoale concluded.
