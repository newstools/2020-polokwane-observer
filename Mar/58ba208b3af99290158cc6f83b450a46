Local business and water supplier H2O Polokwane out of goodwill donated water to law enforcers at various roadblocks in and around the city earlier today (Monday) to keep them hydrated while performing important duties during the lockdown.
Co-owner Jeandr√© Krog and his technician Emmanuel Pheta took to the streets earlier today and delivered 12 crates of bottled water to the respective roadblocks in and around the city.
Krog indicated that the initiative is out of goodwill and to keep officers who have to work in the sun for long hours hydrated. He is planning on delivering water to the roadblocks on a regular basis.
Officers gladly accepted the water and thanked H2O Polokwane for their contribution.
