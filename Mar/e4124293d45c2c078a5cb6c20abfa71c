The lack of the use of protective masks and gloves in public places across Polokwane is evident as the city adjusts to the terms of lockdown that kicked in about 12 hours ago.
Thus far low key activity has been observed along the main arteries and at retail hubs across the city.
The streets appear deserted with most activity having been noticed downtown as shoppers stock up for days ahead.
