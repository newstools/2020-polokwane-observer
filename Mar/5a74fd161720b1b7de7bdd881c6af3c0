The dismembered body of a 11-year-old girl who was reported missing on Monday was found in the Klein Letaba Dam on Tuesday.
According to Provincial Police Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo community members in the area made the discovery.
He indicated that the girl from Dengeza (A) outside Giyani allegedly left her parental home on Sunday and never returned. She was reported missing the following day and a search was immediately conducted without any success, until the discovery was made on Tuesday. When Police arrived on the scene her remains were retrieved from the dam and the discovery made that some body parts were missing.
The motive for the murder is still being investigated but ritual killing cannot be ruled out, according to Mojapelo.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has strongly condemned the killing of an innocent child and has instructed the Police to hunt down the perpetrators.
A search for the suspect(s) has since been launched and anyone with information is requested to contact investigating officer Chris Mabasa on 082 469 0739 or the Crime Stop number 08600 10111.
