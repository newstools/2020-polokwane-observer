Commuters travelling from Mankweng, Segopye and Ga-Mothapo and surrounding areas to Polokwane will have to add an extra R3 to their taxi fare as of Wednesday, 15 July.
For the past two years commuters have been paying R21 for a single trip to Polokwane.
Spokesperson for the Mankweng Taxi Association, Frans Kgasago said the new taxi fare is part of their biannual business routine.
“Commuters will pay R24 for a single trip and the new fare has got nothing to do with the nationwide lockdown.
“We increase the prices every two years and the commuters are aware of that. We engaged with our commuters prior to the announcement and they welcomed the new fare.”
Spokesperson for Seshego Polokwane Taxi Association, Moshita Lekganyane said they have no plans of increasing their taxi fares.
“Our prices are still the same and they won’t be increasing anytime soon.”
