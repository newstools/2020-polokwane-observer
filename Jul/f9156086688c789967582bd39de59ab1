Former Baroka Football Club coach, Sello Chokoe has described the late and former Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila Football Club soccer player, Khunadi Nkoana as one the best midfielders in the country.
The 2011 Nedbank Cup semi-finalist who was speaking at Nkoana’s funeral at Ga-Semenya village in the Moletjie area on Sunday, said he learned a lot from his prodigy.
“If you ask me who is the best midfielder in the country I would say Khunadi. He had exceptional talent, always willing to learn and achieve more. He should have played for the big teams in the country but luck was not on his side. When I heard of his passing I cried, but today I am celebrating him,” Chokoe said.
The former Black Leopards midfielder passed away on Tuesday at the Pietersburg Provincial Hospital after a short illness.
The lanky midfielder started his soccer career at Transnet School of Excellence in Gauteng where he matriculated.
He was part of the historic Baroka team that reached the semi-final in the 2011 Nedbank Cup, defeating several Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs like Moroka Swallows and Kaizer Chiefs along the way. He also won the 2010/11 Vodacom League Limpopo division title with Baroka.
He played for the South African u/23 team under Ephraim Shakes Mashaba. The 28-year-old was the only child and he is survived by his mother, his uncles and aunts.
The funeral was attended by his former teammates and PSL and GladAfrica Championship club representatives.
