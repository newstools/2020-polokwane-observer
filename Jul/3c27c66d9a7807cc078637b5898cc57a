The Department of Education is preparing to phase in other grades from July and August. Gr’s R, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 and 11 are expected to return from 6 July, according to the regulations of the national lockdown. Remaining Gr’s 4, 5, 8 and 9 will be among the last group expected back on 3 August.
The Spokesperson for the Department of Education in Limpopo, Tidimalo Chuene said plans are underway to receive all the learners. She said they are finalising models of time tables to accommodate physically distancing. “We are finalising school nutrition, scholar transport, hygiene, water and sanitation. We are mindful that this is a bigger group and we are looking at a system that will accommodate all the learners,” Chuene said. Pietersburg Comprehensive School (PCS) commenced with the preparations for foundation phase groups on Friday. Teachers at the school were hard at work altering classrooms and sanitising all the learning materials. The school has also created an educational video containing all the regulations of the Covid-19.
Johannah Raselabe, Acting Deputy Principal for the foundation phase said the video will be sent to parents. “We want parents to help learners to familiarise themselves with the regulations before they come to class. We believe with the assistance of their parents they will be able to grasp the message in the video,” Raselabe said. She said they are looking forward to welcoming more than 200 learners at the school. “We miss them and we are excited to welcome them back.
“Each class will have 20 learners and we will ensure that social distancing is maintained,” concluded Raselabe.
Schools that applied for an earlier phased-in return of learners and were approved, have already phased-in some of the other grades.
