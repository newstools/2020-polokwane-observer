In a bid to create a safe environment for public transport operators and users, Polokwane Municipality has allocated a budget of R30 million for the refurbishing and revamping of taxi ranks situated at the city centre. The upgrades are scheduled to begin in August.
Taxis commuting to Sekhukhune, Ga-Molepo, Ga-Maja, Segopje and surrounding areas will be moved to Church Street during the facelift.
The municipality has warned of the possibility of months of traffic congestion and inconvenience during the construction phase.
Communications and Marketing Manager for Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo said the upgrades form part of the broader CBD Movement Plan which seeks to address the current transport challenges experienced in the city.
“We want to improve accessibility and mobility by transport users within the CBD. We want to create a safe environment for public transport operators and users and restructuring and reorganising the sociology-economic ecosystem of the CBD.”
He stressed that the facelifts are also aimed at optimising the available space within the public transport facilities. “These are our efforts to restructure transport movement to and from public transport facilities. We are refurbishing the existing infrastructure within the public transport facilities, upgrading the safety and security environment within and around the public transport facilities.”
Mothapo said it will cost the municipality R14 million to revamp the rank at Spar City Centre and R16 million for the taxi rank next to Pick n Pay.
