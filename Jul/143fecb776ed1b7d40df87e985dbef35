Local professional soccer clubs affiliated to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) are excited to resume training after a three-month break due to the nationwide lockdown.
The Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa gazetted regulations relating to Covid-19 level 3 on 28 May which announced the resumption of sport activities.
According to a statement from the Department of Sport, various sporting codes are submitting their plans, indicating their state of readiness and the stringent health protocols they will implement in accordance to the prescribed regulations.
“The plans submitted by PSL have been approved, considering the mitigation strategies and plans in relation to the level 3 risk-adjusted strategy in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The plans have further been subject to analysis by health authorities, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases who have recommended that the measures put in place by the organisation meet and in some instances exceed the required protocol for a safe return to training and to play in a biologically safe environment.”
Dylan Kerr, head coach at Baroka Football Club said they are excited to return to the football pitch. It has been three months without playing and we can’t wait to get back. We are likely to train on Thursday. All players were tested and are awaiting their results. We are hoping for a clean bill of health. However, I must admit that football won’t be the same because of the long break. It will be tough but we will soldier on,” Kerr concluded.
Chief Operations Officer of Polokwane City Football Club, Tincy Tema said the prospect of returning to football created excitement among the players. “We are ready but cautious, and hope to resume with training during the level 2 and hopefully start playing matches by mid-July. We will ensure that we comply with all the regulations.”
