The Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 inducted Naas Vorster as its new president for 2020/21 during a virtual ceremony on Saturday. By his side was his wife Charlie, who was inducted as President of the Rotary Anns.
Delivering his speech as outgoing President, Horst Meyer congratulated Naas and Charlie and alluded to some of the highlights of his presidential year. He thanked his outgoing board as well as all the Rotarians for their support.
The year started with a business breakfast in an effort to connect people and his first radio interview to engage the community to support the club’s 40th Oktoberfest.
“The Teach a Child to Fish project involved visiting some rural schools and there was no fishing done, I was digging holes to plant trees, we visited shelters and handed out fruit and veggie parcels. The Lego Project brought some much-needed joy to those at the Centenary House and Polokwane Nasorgsentrum. I was amazed at how clever and dedicated the Down Syndrome children are,” Meyer said.
The fête at Our Home/Ons Tuiste as well as the Christmas parties hosted at both Our Home/Ons Tuiste and Martha Hofmeyer Tehuis were much appreciated by the elderly. A successful 4×4 day was also hosted and well supported.
“Regretfully, we had to cancel our annual charity golf day and some other fundraising events due to the lockdown. We have, however, grasped the opportunity to reach out to residents by providing food parcels to the value of more than R2 million.” Meyer thanked all those involved who made this possible.
