Polokwane City, Black Leopards and Baroka Football clubs will not play their last remaining matches of the 2019/20 season at their traditional home grounds, but in Gauteng.
Chairperson of the Premier Soccer League (PSL), Irvin Khoza confirmed that Gauteng will host Premier Soccer League (PSL) and GladAfrica Championship matches during a press conference on Monday.
Khoza reportedly said the South African Football Association (Safa) must still approve the schedule for matches. “KwaZulu-Natal and North West were close contenders to host the matches but the PSL found that Gauteng has the biggest advantage.”
Stadiums that are reportedly to be used as training venues for the 16 PSL teams and 16 GladAfrica Championship are Marks Park, Wanderers, St Stithians, Fourways High, Johannesburg Stadium, Ruimsig Stadium, Auckland Park Bunting (UJ), Chris Hani Stadium (UJ), Loftus Versveld, the University of Pretoria, Pilditch Stadium, TUT Stadium, Germiston Stadium and Vosloorus Stadium.
The following stadiums will reportedly be used for competitive matches when the season resumes: FNB Stadium, Orlando, Dobsonville, Rand Stadium, Makhulong Stadium, Ellis Park, Bidvest Stadium, Loftus Versveld, Lucas Moripe, University of Pretoria and Tsakane. Chief Operations Officer of Polokwane City said they welcome the decision.
“A neutral venue was in the interest of all. We played well before the break and want to keep this up.”
