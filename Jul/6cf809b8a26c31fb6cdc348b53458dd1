Polokwane Municipality had to dispatch water tankers to provide relief to Ivy Park and Nirvana after the water supply was interrupted last Thursday by the closing of valves by unknown persons in an attempt to sabotage the municipality’s efforts to provide services.
“Findings from the municipal water team indicate a mischievous act of closing most of the water supply valves in the areas.
The team has, however, opened a lot of those valves and is still checking on the other valves that might have been closed,” Communications and Marketing Manager of the Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo said on Friday.
He added that the municipality was trying to create a balance in the system to ensure that all areas receive water supply because some areas are experiencing low water pressure while others are not receiving anything.
In the meantime, temporary relief measures through water tankers will continue to provide water supply to the affected areas as the municipality is still trying to deal with this new phenomenon, according to Mothapo.
Mothapo advised consumers to report water-related challenges to the municipal helpline on (015) 290 2376 or (015) 290 2629.
