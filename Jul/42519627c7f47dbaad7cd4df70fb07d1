Premier Chupu Mathabatha instructed the MECs of Social Development, and Transport and Community Safety to come up with a community-based plan to reduce Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in the province.
A visibly agitated Mathabatha said it is a very concerning issue and something drastic will have to be done “or we will become a barbaric society.”
He proposed that the two MEC’s form a task-team to establish community-based structures, including social workers, and that they must come up with a strategy and appropriate implementation plans with clear quantifiable goals, to deal effectively with GBV and “to put an end to such heinous behaviour. Something bad will happen to such a society,” he said.
He said the province must start somewhere, and he would ask Treasury to make available resources for this initiative.
A number of GBV cases, especially where the elderly and young children were involved and murdered, were reported during the last month especially, throughout the province.
He also called on all people, especially the young, to stay at home or go to school, not to attend events at the expense of their lives.
He said the Provincial Command Council (PCC) found a total disregard for rules to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among the people when they visited Seshego and Mankweng recently.
He said the PCC are doing their best to push back the pandemic, save lives and recover the economy, but saving the economy cannot be done if many lives are lost, and vice versa.
He asked the elderly and those with comorbidities to work from home where possible and parents of children not attending schools, to register their children for home schooling. He thanked healthcare workers and volunteers for the sterling work they are doing to ensure the safety of all.
