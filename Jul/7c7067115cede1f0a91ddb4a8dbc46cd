In an effort to flatten the Covid-19 curve, Capricorn District (CDM) Mayor, John Mpe donated Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to traditional leaders and people living with HIV/aids during a ceremony at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium last Tuesday.
“We have resolved to share with you what we received from sponsors and like-minded partners.
“When we started fighting this virus, we established a food bank to share with the needy households in your areas and we managed to distribute over 20 000 food parcels across all our local municipalities and also reached out to schools to donate personal protective equipment across the district. We are grateful to our partners and we appeal to you to help us reinforce our message and encourage our communities in rural areas to observe safety protocols and protect themselves.
“We are therefore pleased to donate 25 litres of sanitiser, masks and detergent as well as thermo sensors to you. In addition, we will be visiting all traditional offices and your royal homes for decontamination and disinfection,” Mpe said before he was accompanied by the Mayor of Molemole, Edward Paya, Kgoshi Maleboho and Mayor of Lepelle-Nkumpi, Merriam Molala to the basement of the stadium where the equipment was handed over to representatives of the recipients.
