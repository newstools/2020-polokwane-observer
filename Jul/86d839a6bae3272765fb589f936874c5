Founder of Ria Stars Football Club, Ria Ledwaba was removed as the vice president of South African Football Association (Safa) during the association’s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting recently held at Safa House in Nasrec.
Ledwaba was voted in as the first woman vice president for Safa in a national council meeting in 2018.
She was dismissed together with other vice president Gay Mokoena for apparently violating the association’s constitution.
Both Ledwaba and Mokoena will continue to serve as members on the Safa NEC.
According to a statement from Safa, the overwhelming majority of the NEC members expressed their disappointment in both Ledwaba and Mokoena in their handling of Safa matters in the public domain and their engagement with third parties.
“The NEC expressed their displeasure at the two’s violation of the Safa’s laid down internal processes and understood this as lack of confidence in the association’s constitutional and governance structures. It is on this basis that the NEC decided that the two vice presidents should be removed and replaced.”
The Safa constitution guarantees that one woman, at the minimum, must be appointed as one of the vice presidents and the association remains committed to promoting women in the decision-making structures.
Safa’s promotion of women in governance structures of football is clearly demonstrated by ensuring, in all structures from LFAs to regional structures, that there is a high number of women representation,” reads the statement.
By the time of going to press Ledwaba could not be reached for comment.
