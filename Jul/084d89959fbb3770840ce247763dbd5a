Star Sign Football Club and HCI Foundation extended some love when they spent the entire Saturday donating food parcels through their Spread Love initiative.
A total of 67 families around Mankweng received food parcels and were happy to be part of the initiative.
Stars Sign FC annually visits drop-in centres to donate food parcels and to spend time with the children.
According to Star Sign Marketing Manager, Cameron Mathebula, the club also registered as an NGO. “The idea was to spread the love. We have decided to feed the people and give them clothes. As a registered non-government organisation, we plan to host various charity initiatives this year,” said Mathebula.
“We will also focus on small tournaments and soccer training programmes to give back to the community.
“One of the principles of Star Sign FC is to give, so it’s very important for us to give whenever we can. We wanted to make sure that on Madiba’s birthday, everyone felt the love he gave the nation.
“We are happy to say that the event was successful and we are humbled by the fact that even though it took various charity organisations to make a difference in these families’ lives we were able to pull together to make it work,” he said.
He concluded by quoting the late Nelson Mandela: “There can be no greater gift than that of giving one’s time and energy to helping others without expecting anything in return,” Emma Mamabolo from Mankweng Unit A, thanked Star Sign FC for the donations.
“I am very happy that Star Sign FC has come to our rescue. The food parcels came at the right time as we were struggling to put food on the table,” she said.
