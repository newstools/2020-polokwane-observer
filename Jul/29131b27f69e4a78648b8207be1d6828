Founder and owner of Baroka Football Club, Khurishi Mphahlele believes the completed first phase of Baroka Sports Complex will give the youth of Seleteng, Lepelle-Nkumpi, Mphahlele and Lebowakgomo and surrounding areas a platform to showcase their sporting talent.
The club started with the construction of the facilities on 14 hectares of land next to the Lebowakgomo showgrounds last year in March.
Mphahlele said that they have completed the training grounds, the change rooms and the administration area.
“We are happy to have completed the first phase of the project which includes a soccer field and administration area. The players are already using the training facility. We are currently busy with the second phase which will boast entertainment facilities for children, accommodation for players, a swimming pool and a gymnasium.”
He added that the project will become a springboard for talented athletes in the area. “This is the only professional football club that is based in the rural area and most sport fields in this area don’t have green grass. Most of the young people in this area play sports on hard fields and surfaces. With this initiative I want to make things easier for them. I want aspiring athletes to make use of this facility and realise their dreams,” Mphahlele said.
He also added that for the second phase of the project more than 35 people from the area will be employed.
