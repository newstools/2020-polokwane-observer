Chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders in Limpopo, Kgoshi Malesela Dikgale said plans are in an advanced stage to increase the number of initiation schools next year to accommodate myriads of young men who missed out on this year’s programme.
The programme, which gives young men an opportunity to learn about societal norms, manhood values, traditional beliefs and customs was suspended in April due to the nationwide lockdown.
The house had already received 329 000 applications from various traditional leaders in the province to run initiation schools set for June and July.
“There will be many applications for next year and we want to make sure that we can accommodate everyone who missed out this year. We don’t know when the virus will subside or end but we are hoping that things will be better next year. Usually we have 300 schools running during the season but we want to increase that number to 500,” Dikgale said.
