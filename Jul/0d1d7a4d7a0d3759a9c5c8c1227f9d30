Westenburg residents, Sampie Lyle and Sarel Martin were inducted as members of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 during a virtual meeting last Thursday.
The President of the club, Horst Meyer thanked Lyle and Martin for the contributions that they have made to the club’s lockdown outreach project as volunteers and for their willingness to now join fellow Rotarians in their quest to be of service to the community in these challenging times.
Meyer reiterated that the new members will now be able to benefit from strong bonds of friendship with fellow Rotarians, locally and worldwide.
Meyer presented the new members with information packs explaining, among others, that the objects of Rotary are the development of acquaintances as an opportunity for service, high ethical standards in business and professions, the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations and the dignifying of each Rotarian’s occupation as an opportunity to serve society.
Other objectives are the application of an ideal of service in every Rotarian’s personal, business and community life and the advancement of international understanding, goodwill and peace through a word fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service.
