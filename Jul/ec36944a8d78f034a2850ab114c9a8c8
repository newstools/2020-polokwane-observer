Like many other businesses, Cansa Polokwane had to close its doors during the nationwide lockdown.
With the announcement of level four came the permission for them to once again open up and help the community.
Office manager, Corné Marais, explains they are busy with a deep-cleaning process in the care home and their offices.
“We would like to once again offer room and meals for patients, as long as they are prepared to adhere to Covid-19 regulations. People who have cancer, have an impaired immune system and therefore we will have stringent protective measures.
“Any person who needs to visit Polokwane for medical procedures and needs to sleep over, is welcome to contact us.”
Certain health tests like breast examinations, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests and pap smears can be done at the Cansa offices on Thursdays.
They also offer a faecal occult home testing kit for colorectal cancer that patients can do in the privacy of their homes.
“We have masks and wraps or buffs available, wigs and medical equipment such as wheelchairs, walker frames and commodes. The M-store is available on appointment.”
The team ask donations of second-
hand clothes that can be sold to raise money as most of their fundraising events had to be cancelled.
To make an appointment or donate some clothes contact Karin Human at (015) 297 1268.
