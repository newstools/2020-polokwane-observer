The Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 recently received a donation of R64 000 for the purchase of food and essential items to be included into the aid parcels that are distributed to needy households during the Covid-19 lockdown.
During a virtual club meeting last Thursday, Rotary Club President Horst Meyer presented a letter of appreciation to Rotarian Bruce Phillips, who represented Luis Figueiredo, Managing Director of the donor, Atlantis Seafood Products (ASP) from the Western Cape.
Phillips explained that Figueiredo was one of his learners at school in his younger days and was so impressed by the Rotarians’ lockdown support project that he wanted to make a contribution. “There are strong ties between Limpopo and the Western Cape and the club’s outreach to drought-stricken farmers in the Northern Cape last year did also not go unnoticed,” Phillips said.
Meyer said that the money will be spent wisely. “We are spending around R10 000 per week on items to include into the aid parcels and believe the demand for help will escalate in times to come,” Meyer said.
