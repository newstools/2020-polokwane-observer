Former Black Leopards and Baroka star, Khunani Nkoana passed away at the Pietersburg Provincial Hospital on Tuesday.
The 28-year-old, who was released by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila last season, played for the ABC Motsepe League side, Magesi Football Club.
The midfield maestro was part of the Baroka team that eliminated Kaizer Chiefs Football Club in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in 2011.
Family spokesperson, Moses Nkoana said Khunadi died unexpectedly after experiencing stomach pains.
“He started complaining of pain on Saturday and was rushed to the Pietersburg Provincial Hospital. After initially being scheduled for an operation, this was later changed and we received the good news that Khunadi was about to be discharged. He died on Tuesday. We are shocked and devastated.”
“He was a good young man and was loved by everybody. He respected everyone and he was not big-headed at all. He was always surrounded by people especially young aspiring soccer players and he had good fashion sense,” Nkoana concluded.
Managing Director of Black Leopards Football Club, Tshifiwa Thidiela said they are saddened by his death.
“He was still young and he contributed a lot to football. He had a good future ahead of him and our heartfelt condolences to his family.”
Spokesperson for Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, Tshidino Ndou said no words can begin to explain how they feel.
“A soldier and a leader has fallen and may his soul rest in peace.”
On their Twitter page, Baroka Football Club said they are saddened by the untimely death of Nkoana. The club conveyed condolences to the family.
