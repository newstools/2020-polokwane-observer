Despite the resolution from the National Taxi Alliance and South African National Taxi Council to have taxis operating at 100% capacity, Great North Transport says they will stick to the 50% loading capacity.
The company, which transports thousands of commuters in the province, confirmed that they have also felt the revenue pinch as a result of the lockdown but pointed out that they value lives more than profit.
Spokesperson for the company, Patrick Monkoe said they have no intentions of operating at 100% capacity.
“The rules and the regulation of the lockdown are very clear. We are a government entity and we cannot be seen violating the rules and the regulations of the lockdown. With 50% capacity we are losing a lot of revenue but lives are more important than profit,” Monkoe remarked.
