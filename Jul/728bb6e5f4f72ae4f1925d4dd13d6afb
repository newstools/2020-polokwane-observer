Several golfers braved the cold, yet sunny morning to participate in an individual stableford format hosted by the Polokwane Golf Club on Saturday.
Players were excited to be back on the greens after the club opened a few weeks ago.
A total of 105 players competed and the jackpot was drawn by Jeandré Britz. The jackpot holes were one, six, 13 and 17 but no one managed to clinch the jackpot.
The two clubs winners were Wynand Pretorius, Willie Opperman, Duane Viljoen, Andries du Plessis and Azhar Sulliman.
Winners:
1. Weyden Peceur with 42 points.
2. Irené van den Ende with 38 points.
3. Bernard Steyn Jr with 37 points.
