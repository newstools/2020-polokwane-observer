Recently inducted President of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100, Naas Vorster has great plans for his 2020/21 presidential year.
“The nationwide lockdown disrupted our way of doing things, not only in our personal lives but also our businesses.
It will be challenging for me initially, as planning of events will be a lot different than usual. We will need to make sure we comply to certain regulations.
For someone who is not a Rotarian it is difficult to understand what it is that we do.
What this club has done in support of the community during the lockdown is nothing short of amazing and words cannot describe it.
At a later stage we will get to thank everyone who assisted.”
Vorster announced the club’s board members; Orrie Baragwanath (Deputy President), Horst Meyer (Secretary), Pieter Meintjies (Treasurer) and Avenue Chairpersons Clive Baragwanath (Community Service), John Kirkpatrick (International), John Dunlevey (Vocational), Johan Joubert (Social) and additional members Peter Mockford and Casper Gilfillan.
“Pietersburg 100 is not just a Rotary Club, we are a family, we have our differences, but our true colours show when we need to stand together – and boy do we do that well,” Vorster said before thanking his wife Charlie and family members for their support.
Vorster congratulated outgoing President Horst Meyer for a sterling job done and the club’s achievement for being voted the best Rotary Club in the district.
In closing, Vorster quoted Jack Canfield: “Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures. They prefer to take steps to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.”
