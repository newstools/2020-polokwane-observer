Talented cricketer, Lerato Kgoatle, scooped Cricket South Africa’s (CSA) T20 Cricketer of the Year Award during the virtual awards ceremony held on Saturday.
The right-hander made a name for himself when he recorded not one but unbeaten hundreds for Limpopo during the Africa T20 Cup last season.
The former Seshego Cricket Club middle order batsman was included in the Northerns Cricket team squad for the 2015 Africa T20 Cup.
In September 2018 he was named in Limpopo’s squad for the 2018 Africa T20 Cup. A year later he was named in Limpopo’s squad for the 2019/20 CSA Provincial T20 Cup.
The lanky batsman dedicated his award to his family and coaches.
“I don’t think I would be where I am today if it was not for them, their support and guidance. This is my first major award and a sign of bigger things to come.” He signed a lucrative deal with Western Province Cricket Association earlier this year.
He says he can’t wait to join his new teammates after the lockdown. “It has always been my dream to play cricket at the top level and I can’t wait for the new chapter of my life.”
