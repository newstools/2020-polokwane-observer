The Limpopo Provincial Command Council forced a prominent supermarket in Seshego to close last week after finding that the owners were not adhering to Covid-19 safety precautions.
No sanitiser was made available at the paypoints, and the store manager was arrested.
Last week, Premier Chupu Mathabatha and members of the council revisited hotspots in Seshego and Mankweng, following the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the province.
The Provincial Command Council noted that there are over 1 000 infections and five deaths, with currently more than 600 active cases.
This number continues to rise against the tide of ignorance and disregard of present rules.
The council furthermore commended the police for maintaining law and order amid village and township soccer tournaments mushrooming around the province.
The premier expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that many residents in various areas have become complacent while the virus infections continue to rise.
“People are no longer respecting the basic guidelines. We said perhaps we need to go back to that old push-back strategy, and the push-back strategy said people must be aware. We must educate our people on the dangers of this virus. Those found to be non-compliant will find themselves on the wrong side of the law. When the president says people must comply, they have to comply,” said Mathabatha. He said sanitising, hand-washing, and social distancing are non-negotiables in the fight against Covid-19. “We are concerned with what we have seen happening in villages. I spoke about the non-compliance and we have instructed that no village organises soccer tournaments. People should not participate in organised soccer or any other tournament. We are concerned about social distancing, and we are also concerned about the communities where liquor is abused,” he concluded.
