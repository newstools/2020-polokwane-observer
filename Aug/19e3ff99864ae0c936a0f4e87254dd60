South African football is known for skills and thrills and the football lingo that is synonymous with the beautiful game.
Fans and football enthusiasts flock to stadiums weekly to enjoy the exciting matches and traditions. Skills such as shobibo (nutmeg), show me your number and tsamaya (dribble past) displayed by players on the field during matches to make the game more lively.
But for those not understanding some of the terms and moves it might sometimes be unclear what spectators are getting excited about.
There is nothing that pleases South African football lovers more than seeing a talented skillful player pull a Shibobo (nutmeg) on an opponent. This skill refers to a player passing the ball between the opponentâ€™s legs which is beloved and displayed by up-and-coming soccer players and those in the professional set up.
Some players would usually follow-up with a Tsamaya, which means a feint.
This is the skill that would make fans stand up on their seats with applause and lauding the player.
The country is also well-endowed with players that can kick a Bazooka (a thunderous shot).
Premier Soccer League (PSL) players such as Hlompho Kekana, Thabo Matlaba, Mpho Makola and Rhulani Manzini are some of the players in the modern game who can perfect the shot with ease.
