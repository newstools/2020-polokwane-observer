Although money scams around the city have declined, Police Spokesperson, Col Moatshe Ngoepe emphasised that residents should still be vigilant who they trust with money or personal belongings.
This comes after Polokwane Observer was alerted of a few scams doing the rounds.
In one instance a resident was promised accommodation for a suspiciously cheap amount. The so-called scammer insisted that the accommodation was in high demand and a deposit, or half of it should be paid in advance. Once a deposit was paid the person would abscond.
Theft out of motor vehicles was also recently reported at fast food drive-thru’s where two suspects allegedly work together targeting motorists. It is reported that one would distract the driver by asking random questions while the other would reach inside the vehicle to snatch the driver’s personal belongings. A woman from Gauteng also became a victim when she was robbed of her designer handbag while getting out of a taxi in the city.
