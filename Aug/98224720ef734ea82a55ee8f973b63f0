The Department of Health intends to appeal against a judgement delivered by the Limpopo Division of the High Court in Polokwane last Thursday in the matter between six businesses (the applicants) that were previously contracted to supply and deliver perishable goods to 44 public hospitals in the province and the department.
The contracts recently expired and the applicants requested the court to order as an interim measure that the status quo regarding the supply and delivery of goods to the hospitals by themselves, be maintained until a new bidding process has been followed, and that the department’s latest decision to award the multi-million Rand new contract to 77 new businesses (added as respondents), be reviewed and set aside. The applicants also requested that Health MEC, Dr Phophi Ramathuba and the other respondents be ordered to pay the costs of the application.
The previous contractors alleged in their application that the latest tenders were unduly awarded to the 77 businesses and claimed that the department awarded the most tenders to one individual who is said to own eight of the businesses.
The court ruled in favour of the applicants and on Friday, Spokesperson for Health, Neil Shikwambana confirmed that subsequent to studying the judgement, the department has instructed its legal team to seek leave to appeal the judgement delivered by Limpopo Judge President Ephraim Makgoba.
Earlier this month, the department was also accused of unduly awarding tenders for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to family members and friends of politicians. The department denied the allegations and subsequently published a list of companies that were recipients of PPE contracts to a value of over R400-million, while Shikwambana said that the department has been transparent about the businesses contracted to provide PPEs.
Following appeals by President Cyril Ramaphosa in recent addresses to the public, National Treasury has recently urged law enforcement agencies to probe and take urgent action against companies involved in PPE corruption.
