A community builder and philanthropist, Mathews Ledwaba is building a 30m swimming pool in the heart of Ga-Maraba village to cater for all aspiring swimmers in the area and surrounds.
Ledwaba said that with the initiative, he aims to bridge the gap between the privileged and the poor.
“There are but a few swimming pools in Polokwane and it is difficult for children in the villages to access those facilities. There is also the myth that swimming is an elite sport and we want to quell that myth. There are many talented swimmers in the villages who want to become professional swimmers but they don’t know which route to take. The swimming pool will give those swimmers the platform to showcase their talent, enjoy swimming and its benefits.”
The first phase of the children’s swimming pool has already been completed, he said, and he hopes to complete the pool before the end of the year.
Plans to hire lifeguards and swimming instructors who will equip children with swimming skills are at an advanced stage, he confirmed.
“Being able to swim is an essential life-saving skill and learning to swim is a skill that once learnt is rarely forgotten.
“The swimming pool is for all the children in the community and we want people who can coach swimming. We had stories of children drowning during school excursions and other recreational activities and that bothered me. We want to curb the number of drowning accidents. If they are equipped with swimming lessons they will be able to enjoy their excursions and recreational swimming activities without any hindrances.”
He added that he would love to host provincial and national swimming championships and competitions in the area in the near future.
“It will be great to see schools in the Central Business District travelling to Ga-Maraba to participate in major swimming competitions. This will be an opportunity for swimmers from all backgrounds to learn from each other and grow the sporting code.”
