The Chairperson of the Premier Soccer League (PSL), Irvin Khoza has confirmed that the last remaining matches of the league will be played from 8 August and will be completed in September.
Khoza was speaking at the National Soccer League Board (NSL) of Governors’s virtual meeting to deliberate on the resumption of the 2019/20 season in Gauteng on Monday.
The first fixture will be the Nedbank Cup semi-finals.
This will be followed by the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship fixtures. Dates and kick-off times will be confirmed in due course. The league was put on hold for four-month due to the nationwide lockdown.
Khoza said this announcement will assist in lifting the mood of the country and also in mitigating some of the challenges faced by our country and the global community.
“We have informed our stakeholders including the Minister of Sport, the MEC of Sport in Gauteng, Safa, the broadcasters SuperSport, Absa, Nedbank, GladAfrica and SAFPU about the plans. All the clubs in the PSL are able to comply with the protocols.”
Khoza confirmed that the remainder of the season will be played in a biologically safe environment in Gauteng.
Local PSL clubs, Polokwane City, Baroka and Black Leopards are expected to travel to Gauteng in the first week of August. Chief Operations Officer for Polokwane City Football Club, Tincy Tema said they are looking forward to the resumption of the league.
“We have a clean bill of health in our squad. We are concerned about playing in Gauteng as it is South Africa ‘s Covid-19 epicentre, but we must complete the season to avoid implications. There are clubs that are fighting for relegation and some fighting for the title, so the league must be completed.”
Tshifhiwa Thidiela, Managing Director of Black Leopards Football Club whose club in last position said they are looking forward to the last remaining matches of the league. “It won’t be easy but we are aiming to collect maximum points.”
