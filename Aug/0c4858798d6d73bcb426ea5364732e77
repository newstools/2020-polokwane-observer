A mother and her children narrowly escaped death after a fire damaged two rooms in a house situated in Nirvana on Monday afternoon.
The back of the house, situated in Crescent Drive, was engulfed in flames and firefighters, residents and members of the Tactical Reaction Service team swiftly responded in an effort to assist in extinguishing the fire.
The fire was first noticed by the domestic worker.
By the time Polokwane Observer and the local fire brigade arrived on the scene, the fire was already under control and firefighters only had to ensure that the smouldering debris was properly doused.
Empty fire extinguishers scattered across the scene were evident of residents’ and crime fighters’ efforts to save the house from complete destruction.
While the cause of the fire is unknown, the family will have to temporarily relocate due to the damage and dangers caused by the fire. The owner of the house was not present at the time of the incident.
