PEMPS’ chess queen, Saralie Bezuidenhout believes more learners should participate in the sporting code and leverage on its benefits.
Bezuidenhout is the head of chess and a mathematics teacher at the school.
She wants to promote chess among learners and unleash their potential.
“There is a perception among learners that chess is difficult and has many rules. These rules will, however, help them with problem-solving and win each and every challenge life throws at them. Through chess, learners learn to observe, pay attention and not make hasty decisions.”
Bezuidenhout’s chess team started with 20 players two years ago, and currently has 60 players.
“Our team has grown in leaps and bounds. We want more players in the team because chess can help them improve their academic work. It can also help them to improve their concentration in class and teach them how to handle themselves under pressure.”
She is proud of the strides she has made since joining the school in 2018. “We have produced quality chess players who consistently represent the school at the Capricorn district finals every year. We host an annual clans competition which sees chess players from Pietersburg Comprehensive School, PEPPS and Mitchell House come together to compete.”
Bezuidenhout would love to see players from the school play chess at top level. “We have learners such as Tennaka Bokosi, Mulanga Rhamphumedzi and Joseph Manesh who have shown dedication and glimpses of brilliance in various competitions. They are capable of representing us at the top level,” concluded Bezuidenhout.
