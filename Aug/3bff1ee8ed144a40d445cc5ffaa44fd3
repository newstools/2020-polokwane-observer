It is imperative that all the donations in kind that are meant to assist vulnerable communities, should find its way to the intended beneficiaries, and the Polokwane Municipality and its social partners will do all in its power to ensure that this happens.
This was emphasised by the Mayor, Thembi Nkadimeng during an event to hand over food and other supplies which are necessary to assist victims of gender-based violence at the Seshego Hospital during a handover last Wednesday afternoon.
The donations were provided by Anglo Platinum Polokwane Smelters and destined for use by the Thuthuzela Victim Empowerment Centre based at the hospital.
The Thuthuzela Victim Empowerment Centre is managed by the National Prosecuting Authority in partnership with the police and the Department of Health.
Most victims at the centre are victims of rape and gender-based violence, and include women and children.
