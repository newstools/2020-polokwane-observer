With the province’s rain season still months away, dam levels are quickly declining and running dry. According to the Spokesperson of the Polokwane Municipality, Thipa Selala by the weekend the Ebenezer Dam water level was below 13%.
The situation is worsened by the unprecedented low rainfall experienced in the previous rain season. According the Selala the latest average daily supply from this scheme has reduced from 36 mega litres per day to about 20 mega litres per day.
The municipality is currently in consultation with Lepelle Northern Water and the provincial and national government regarding the situation and will announce plans and measures to be implemented to ensure the remaining supply can sustain until the rainy season. The measures will include restrictive measures.
“The situation at Ebenezer will have a serious impact on water supply to all areas of supply, particularly those areas receiving water from the Ebenezer.
The supply area are the city, urban areas as well as an extensive scale of rural areas,” Selala said.
The municipality urges residents to play their part to conserve the little water that is available by restricting domestic consumption to household use only and use as little water as possible.
Use of water for gardening and washing of vehicles is highly discouraged at this stage.
The level of the Doorndraai Dam that provides water to Mokopane and surrounding area, is at a low of 10,4%, while the level of the Tzaneen Dam is at 15,1%.
The Flag Boshielo, Hans Merensky and Magoebaskloof dams are all between 95% and 100% and the Flag Boshielo Dam is currently at 97,9% of capacity. These dams however, do not supply water to Polokwane.
Water saving tips:
Hygiene:
• Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth and washing your hair. You save nine litres of water.
• Take a five minute shower and save up to 100 litres.
• Flush less, place a 2l bottle filled with water in your cistern.
Household:
• Fix leaky taps – even a slow drip can waste 30 litres a day.
• If you fill two sinks; one with soapy water and one with warm water for rinsing, this will use less water than a dishwasher.
• Wash your clothes in cold water to save water and energy.
• Sweep away leaves and debris rather than using a hose to spray it away.
• Put buckets in the shower for run-off water and under drains to catch water when it rain to water your garden.
• Plant a water-wise garden with indigenous drought-resistant plant.
• Use a watering can to make sure the water goes where it’s needed.
