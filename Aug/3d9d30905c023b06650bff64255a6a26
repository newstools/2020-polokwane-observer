Administrators of Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs in Limpopo have welcomed the decision by the PSL to complete the last remaining matches of the league in Gauteng as opposed to their traditional home grounds.
The league selected Gauteng as the preferred location for the Biological Safe Environment (BSE) due to the Covid-19 pandemic and all teams will be based in the province for the duration of the matches.
Chief Operations Officer of Polokwane City Football Club, Tincy Tema described Gauteng as a different environment and their second home. “This arrangement is new to everyone but whenever we play matches in Gauteng we managed to produce good results. We are ready. To prepare the team we have organised a mini BSE in Polokwane. The team will camp in that environment. This is done to prepare the players for the main BSE in Gauteng. The camp will assist them to settle well in Gauteng.”
He also added that none of their players tested positive for Covid-19 and they are all ready for selection.
City is currently in the 14th position and they need maximum points in order to avoid possible relegation. “We are not in a good position and we need points. What we can promise our supporters is that we will fight for every point,” Tema said. Tshifiwa Thidiela, Managing Director of Black Leopards admitted that it will be difficult to complete the season away from home. “ Playing away from our home will definitely have an impact on the team. It is a disadvantage for us because we are used to playing in front of our supporters. However, we are ready, we know we are in the last position and we have to win matches to avoid relegation. We will leave no stone unturned. We will go out there and fight for points.”
All the fixtures will be played in the BSE at various venues in Gauteng from 11 August.
