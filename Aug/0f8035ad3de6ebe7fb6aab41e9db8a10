Representatives of various institutions that provide for those in need received the second batch of a consignment of over 20 tons of fruit and vegetables during a handover ceremony at the Polokwane Fresh Produce Market (Freshlinq) on Friday.
The goods were purchased from a donation made by AgriSA through its disaster aid fund and were destined for distribution to destitute households in and around the city through the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100’s lockdown support depot, to Martha Hofmeyer Tehuis, Our Home/Ons Tuiste, Eeufeeshuis, N.G. Moedergemeente Pietersburg and N.G. Kerk Pietersburg-Oos.
Representatives from the Abraham Kriel Kinderhuis in Modimolle and a number of charitable institutions in Mokopane and Roedtan were also present to collect their donations.
The CEO of Agri Limpopo, Deirdre Carter explained that it was learnt that the institutions were in short supply of fruit and vegetables and that an application was made to AgriSA to allocate funds to assist.
“The funds were donated to AgriSA by various donors and after negotiations with the Mike Louftie Foundation and RSA Markagente, we were able to assist in this way,” Carter said.
The President of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg, Naas Vorster said that the lockdown support depot has to date provided more than 250 tons of fruit and vegetables to a value of more than R2,65 million as part of the food parcels that were distributed to more than 12 000 individuals since the lockdown started.
