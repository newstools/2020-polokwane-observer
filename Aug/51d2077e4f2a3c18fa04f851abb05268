Police and members of the Community Policing Forum (CPF) joined efforts on Tuesday evening to arrest those not adhering to Covid-19 regulations, especially loiterers around town after 22:00.
A group crime fighters of Doornbult and Tweefontein CPF as well police members from Polokwane and the K9 unit gathered at the police station where they were briefed by Visible Policing Commander, André Kotze.
The group was divided into three teams who simultaneously targeted residential areas as well as in the Central Business District. A total of 32 suspects were arrested for being on the street without reason or a permit after the curfew.
Authorities also used the opportunity to search open fields where homeless people are known to sleep, and various suspected stolen items were recovered in the field behind Our Home Old Age home. According to officers on the scene the stolen items were most likely nabbed during house robberies in the area.
Passing motorists were also stopped and their vehicles searched.
On Friday evening, CPF members and Westenburg police embarked on an operation on the smallholdings of Tweefontein and Doornbult, searching for illegal immigrants and stolen property.
Several dangerous weapons were confiscated from dwellings in the area and everyone found in shacks and compounds was requested to produce documentation.
“We recently had several incidents in the area of break-ins and theft from smallholdings. The operation was aimed at arresting illegal immigrants but most importantly to maintain visibility in the area,” Doornbult CPD Chairperson, Bennie Henning said.
