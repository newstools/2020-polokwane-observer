Prudence Maloka’s business acumen is gaining her recognition in business circles.
The 23-year-old entrepreneur was a finalist for Miss Career Africa and has now been nominated for the Santam Women of the Future Awards 2020 under the Rising Star category.
“I am humbled to have been nominated by the people who recognise the hard work and passion I put into everything that I do. It motivates me to do even more,” she said.
Maloka is in the events management industry and she is the founder of The Networking Cocktail Event, a project that brings entrepreneurs and corporations under the same roof to network and solicit business. “The concept has been a huge success because of the guidance it gives entrepreneurs who would under different circumstances not know where to begin in connecting with the right people to grow their businesses,” she said.
She added that she has grown tremendously over the past few months as a result of the nationwide lockdown, and added that this had a massive effect on the events industry.
She explained that with the strict regulations, business has been slow but she has opted to see it as an opportunity do some self-introspecting.
“To young businesswomen out there; if you can think it, dream it then you can be it and live it. Always remember that the best way to predict your future is to create it,” she said.
The Santam Women of the Future Awards ceremony is set to take place on 16 October and the Santam Rising Star stands a chance to win R50 000 among other amazing prizes.
