Beneficiaries of government’s Social Relief Fund grant of R350 have the option of the money being paid directly into their bank accounts, or to queue at the Post Office. They also have the option of moving from one bank to another, as of 3 August.
The latest arrangement comes after scores of people had been lining up at their local Post Offices to receive their grants. This could be noted around the city and places such as Cycad Centre’s Post Office, the Post Office in Ladanna and Nirvana.
Sassa Spokesperson Norman Kutama says the new payment method allows beneficiaries to move from one method to the other at any point and time.
According to Kutama the need to change the method of payment is to minimise queues at one payment channel.
Those who wish to change their payment methods can visit the official Sassa website at https://srd.sassa.gov.za, where they can provide their ID and will receive an SMS with a link that will prompt them to provide banking details.
“As a beneficiary you can provide your surname as per ID document, and be prompted to choose a bank name, choose branch code, choose account type, provide account number and click submit button.”
Beneficiaries who are yet to apply can submit their banking details in the form of a bank account verification form from the bank when applying for a grant at any Sassa local office.
Kutama says Sassa has also separated payment files for older persons and those with disability grants to be paid on different days to ensure compliance to Covid-19 regulations.
“Older person were paid on Monday, 3 August while people living with disabilities were paid the next day. Other grants including the child support grant were paid from the Wednesday, 5 August.”
According to Kutama, Sassa has to date approved 700 878 beneficiaries in Limpopo for the R350 relief grant.
