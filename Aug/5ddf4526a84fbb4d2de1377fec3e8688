The Pietersburg Jukskei Club recently became a target when criminals broke in and damaged the clubhouse.
This was, however, not the first time, Limpopo Jukskei organiser, Anton Botha, explained.
He said in the past, they have had to reinforce security measures at the club house in an effort to secure the structure. This cost around R6 000.
“All this reinforcement was in vain. Last Tuesday, Thabo Mahapa from the Department of Sport contacted me, informing me about the break-in. Apart from the fact that it seems as if the person responsible has been staying in the clubhouse for some time, there are many items that were stolen.”
He said this includes crockery and eating utensils, two microwave ovens, a toaster, frying pan, gas bottle, hot plate, pots and bowls, and clothes and plastic chairs.
“The vandal also sawed off all the wooden light poles on the field and stole the lights as well as all the doors to the kitchen, hall and bathrooms. We were lucky to have been able to save the refrigerators, wooden benches, tables, trophies, and portraits.”
“The police told me it is not worth it to try and take fingerprints and that we should rather remove whatever is left,” he said.
Due to the cost involved the alarm system is not connected to any security company.
A case of burglary has been opened.
