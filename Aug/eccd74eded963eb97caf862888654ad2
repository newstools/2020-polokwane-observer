Saturdays are synonymous with golf and this tradition saw 111 players flock to the Polokwane Golf Club on Saturday.
The day was played in an individual stableford format and golfers took every opportunity to improve their skills. An individual stableford is a scoring system whereby points are awarded on each hole according to how the player plays against their handicap.
The competition counts the total number of strokes taken, as in stroke play, and it involves scoring points based on the number of strokes played at each hole.
The jackpot holes were six, eight, nine and 18, drawn by Aaron Segwapa, there were no winners. Two-clubs for the day were; Luanie van Rooyen, Peter Masehela (x2), Thabo Shingange and Andries du Plessis.
Winners:
• Thabo Shingange with 41 points.
• Randall Jooste with 39 points.
• Andries du Plessis with 38 points.
