If you love the colour pink, then Malibus Polokwane is definitely the place for you.
The founder and owner of Limpopo Beauty Modelling Academy Katryn Celliers was delighted to introduce Malibus Polokwane, as well as her business partner Itumeleng Modise to guests at their grand opening of the beautifully designed cafe and beauty salon.
The event took place on Saturday, 22 August where Itumeleng and Katryn cut the ribbon, in true pink fashion, to declare this one-of-a-kind beauty salon officially open. ‘Why fit in when you were born to stand out?’ This was the leading phrase at the Limpopo Beauty Modelling Academy influencer, photoshoot and competition, which was hosted as part of the grand opening.
“Malibus is a unique and ‘Instagrammable’ café and beauty salon, offering a luxury experience, a very first of its kind in South Africa.
“We teach young girls how to become the best version of themselves through fashion and modelling activities,” Katryn said.
Keep an eye out on social media for the entrants, as the Malibus influencer will be determined after their content creation was judged this week.
“I believe that every woman deserves to feel special, we believe in women empowerment and therefore our main focus at Malibus ensures that every client goes home feeling inspired, rejuvenated and empowered. Reminding them of their true beauty and role in society through our unique beauty experience,” she said.
