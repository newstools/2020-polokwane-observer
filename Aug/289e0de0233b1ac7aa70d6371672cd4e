Scouts and cubs from the First Polokwane Scout Group delivered a consignment of Jars of Hope, which contain soup mixes, to the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100 on Saturday morning.
The food packs will be included in the food parcels that the Rotarians are distributing in and around the city.
Assistant pack scouter Tracey Wulff explained that the scouts and cubs held a virtual meeting on Mandela Day when they decorated the jars that are destined for people in need.
These jars were then filled with rice, lentils, soup mix, a packet of instant soup and stock cubes.
Wulff said that Covid-19 has had a direct impact on the lives of many.
“The colder winter weather adds to their strife, both physically and mentally. Being given a jar of soup ingredients that can provide a warm meal for four people could offer some solace and hope, and might even bring a smile to their faces,” she reckoned.
“Every year, scouts around the country honour our late patron, Nelson Mandela by giving at least 67 minutes of their time for a worthy cause and we have decided to take the opportunity to use the networking abilities of the Rotarians to distribute the donation to people that are really in need,” Wulff added.
The President of the Rotary Club of Pietersburg 100, Naas Vorster thanked the scouts for the gesture and said that there is currently a great need for food to destitute households in the city and that the Jars of Hope will spread a message of goodwill.
