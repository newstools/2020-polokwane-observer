Members of the Rotary Club of Polokwane recently strengthened their relationship with Siloe School for the Blind when they delivered three Covid-19 mobile hand washing stations to the school.
President of the club, Pierre Mouton was joined by Rotarians, Debi Lilford, Marius Liebenberg and Jerry Malahlela who coached the recipients of the equipment on how to effectively utilise the mobile washing stations.
Liebenberg said that the stations were fabricated by members of the club with the assistance of a young intern welder who is currently doing his practicals at the school. “We have learned that the learners at the school experienced challenges to use conventional sanitising bottles effectively and took the opportunity to be part of the solution,” Liebenberg explained.
Malahlela, a skilled welder and who has assisted with the production, said that he was overwhelmed by the gratitude shown by the recipients.
