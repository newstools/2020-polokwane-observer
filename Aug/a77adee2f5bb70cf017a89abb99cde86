The fear of infecting your loved ones once testing positive for Covid-19 is the most overpowering thought that runs through a person’s mind. These are the words of a resident who recently tested positive for the virus.
Andrew* adds that he did not realise he was sick, as he only suffered from headaches of which he took painkillers. “Later I started feeling weak and began to cough. This is when I decided to consult a doctor. When the doctor examined me he found that my fever was high and referred me for Covid-19 testing. I am still not sure how I contracted the virus, as I am not sure whether I was in contact with someone who had it, because no one I was in contact with showed any symptoms or tested positive.”
Andrew tested on 2 July and received his results the following day. He remembers his symptoms only being headaches, coughing and feeling paralised as he was too weak to do anything for himself.
“When I tested positive, at first I could not believe it. I was so worried about my family, especially my children and their health. Questions like, what should I do now and who can I tell, were running through my mind. I thank God for the wonderful support system of my family, without them I don’t know how I would have pulled through, because it was really a challenging time for me. The headaches were so bad I could not sleep.”
Within eight days, Andrew says, he started feeling better, but the doctor instructed him to isolate for 14 days and that is what he did.
Andrew adds he was very positive from day one, but there were a lot of times he just could not get out of bed. There were times when he felt down, especially when he watched the news and saw how many healthcare workers have died as a result of Covid-19. “Going through this experience can leave a person very anxious and also discouraged at time, thinking you might be the next person on the list of statistics. The most prominent emotions I experienced was fear and uncertainty. I called my family together and explained to them. To others I sent WhatsApp messages on our family WhatsApp group. I was afraid of dying, especially when I saw how many people die from the virus. I was worried I will infect my children or other people I was in contact with before I got ill. Someone might have died because of me.

Polokwane Observer spoke to psychologist, Zelda Buitendag who shared some tips on how to deal with the anxiety that goes hand-in-hand with testing positive for Covid-19 or waiting for your test results:
• Depending on where you test, it may take only a few hours or a few days before you receive your results. “It is important to take note of this time period, as it can play a major role in one’s level of anxiety.”
•If you experience difficulties with anxiety, this may affect how you cope when waiting for your results. “Try and practice healthy coping techniques you found helpful in the past, like keeping busy, listening to music, exercises and being creative.”
• Take it slow, focus on relaxation an breathing exercises. “Breath in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth.”
• Be very careful what you think about. “The mind is very powerful. Write down how you feel and what you think. This may help put things in perspective. It may also help you confront irrational thoughts.”
• Take things step by step and day by day. “Don’t go into worst case scenarios, that will only affect your coping negatively.”
•Seek professional help if you feel overwhelmed. “Speak to a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, counsellor, pastor and friends or family.”
