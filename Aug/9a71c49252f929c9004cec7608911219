A new firearm amnesty for a period of six months, which commenced on 1 August will provide for firearm owners to surrender their weapons and ammunition until 31 January 2021.
The previous amnesty period which was also intended for a period of six months, between December 2019 and May 2020 was thwarted by the unexpected Covid-19 pandemic.
Despite this, the South African Police Service received a resounding 46 714 firearms.
The police, however, believe that there are more firearms that still need to be surrendered and they are confident the response to the previous amnesty would have been even more resounding had it not been for the pandemic.
The restrictions of levels four and five prevented people from turning in illegal as well as their unlicensed and unwanted firearms and ammunition.
This had prompted the Minister of Police, General Bheki Cele to approach parliament to approve a new application of a six-month amnesty period.
The police urge people to take advantage of this period either to hand in those firearms and ammunition for destruction or renewal of a competency certificate and a valid licence.
The firearm amnesty envisages a reduced number of illegally possessed firearms in circulation in the country. It therefore provides firearm owners with the opportunity to hand in illegal and unwanted firearms which will result in the prevention of crime and promotion of safety to ensure people living in South Africa are and feel safe.
